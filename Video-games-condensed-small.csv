92,Komodo Chess 8 - Multiprocessor version,"[""Komodo is a chess program that is different from the rest. Its search makes greater use of extensions than any other top engine, which allows Komodo to often see deeper than any other engine, even if it is displaying a slightly lower search depth. The evaluation differs from its main rivals because it represents a blend of both automated tuning and the judgment of a grandmaster and computer expert (Larry Kaufman). Fully automated evaluations are subject to rather large sample error, and applying some chess judgment appears to be beneficial, both in results and in the reasonableness of reported evaluations. Komodo is primarily known for superb positional play. Of course it also one of the the top few engines in tactical strength, but the programmers have not been willing to sacrifice positional play just to score better on tactical problem sets. All good engines are far stronger tactically than any human player, but that when positional judgment is involved, top grandmasters are still superior. Therefore it makes sense to emphasize positional play rather than tactical skill; it is better to improve one's weakest point rather than just to further improve the strongest feature. Komodo is especially useful for opening analysis, because its grandmaster programmer has always made sure that the program's evaluations agree in general with accepted theory. Komodo also excels in the evaluation of positions with material imbalance, which it handles more correctly than other top engines. The endgame of Komodo has been improved by the use of Syzygy tablebases, which provide only the most essential information to save time and memory. Another unique feature of Komodo is its superior performance when using eight or more cores. There is little doubt that Komodo 8 will be the top rated commercial chess engine on most rating lists."", '', '']"

Although many of its elements tie into the greater Final Fantasy universe, this is but a faint echo of what you have come to know and love.\n\nWhile it can be argued that this is a new direction for the series, and therefore shouldn't be put on the same level as the other games, fans have come to expect the best from Final Fantasy, and with each passing release, Square has delivered. Crystal Chronicles may break new ground, but it lacks the creativity and passion of its role-playing brethren. \n\nAs stylish as the character designs may be, they are completely void of personality. The story is just as ambiguous. Never once did I feel attached to my character, nor did I care what twists or turns the plot would make. The Final Fantasy games are renowned for storytelling, but it seems like an afterthought in Crystal Chronicles. Cinematic flair is also noticeably absent.\n\nThe gameplay is just as careless and jagged. While the quest can be played single-player, it's meant to be tackled by a group of people (preferably four). Since each player utilizes menu screens often, Square and Game Designer's Studio decided that you could only play multiplayer with a Game Boy Advance attached to the GameCube. Hence, all menu management is done on the GBA screen, and the action on the TV is unaffected. In theory, this is a just solution. As it turns out, though, I found it to be more detrimental to the quest than anything.""]"

166,GRAND THEFT AUTO SAN ANDREAS,"['<div id=""1upReviewInfo""> <b>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</b>', '<em>By John Davison</em> -- 25/10/2004', 'San Andreas is very different from other games, though. It is a very big game. The term ""big"" really doesn\'t do it justice. It\'s huge, massive, colossal, stupendous, and somewhat humbling in its enormity. No matter what expectations you\'ve developed based on the information that has dribbled out over the course of the past six months, you are wrong. If you\'re expecting <strong>Vice City</strong>, only set in the \'90s and with some RPG bits, you are wrong. If you believe they can\'t possibly push it as much as they have before, that it can\'t really be that good, you are wrong. San Andreas is shocking, not necessarily because of its typically contentious subject matter (though there\'s plenty in it to rub those of a conservative disposition the wrong way) but because of the sheer scale of the experience.', 'There are so many facets to the experience, I can\'t possibly describe them all here, but I will attempt to outline what makes San Andreas such a significant game. Based on my progress for the OPM exclusive, you could extrapolate that it would take about 72 hours to score 100 percent. This would, of course, be true if the game were a completely linear experience. It\'s not. Much like <strong>GTA3</strong> and Vice City, you can ""beat"" the game by completing only the core missions that progress the story. There are people at Rockstar I\'ve spoken to who have finished the main story but have completed less than 60 percent of the entire game. By just plodding through the story, though, you\'re going to miss a lot. Conservatively, I would guess that there\'s definitely more than 100 hours of gameplay here if you want to do everything. The notion of a ""digital sandbox"" was bandied around quite liberally in the past in association with this franchise, but never has it been so apt. The game world is so rich and so packed with surprises that the enjoyment of just existing within it is its own reward.', 'Aside from its size, the other immediately apparent thing about the game is that it looks infinitely superior to Vice City. Environments are rich with detail and packed with effects, whether they are beautiful sunrises bleaching out your view or huge storms breaking with rain as thunder and lightning crashes overhead. <p align=""center""> <table bgcolor=""#666666"" border=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" width=""540""> <tr> <td> <table border=""0"" cellpadding=""8"" cellspacing=""1"" width=""540""> <tr> <td bgcolor=""#ffffff""> <img align=""left"" height=""224"" hspace=""10"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/partner/1up/reviews/1265187"" vspace=""5"" width=""320"">', '<span style=""color:#666666; font-weight:bold; font-size:14px; font-family:verdana;""> Territorial Spray </span>', ""Well, it's <i>one</i> of the new collectibles, anyway... </span> </td> </tr> </table> </td> </tr> </table>"", ""The first eight or nine hours of the game take place in Los Santos and are very gang focused. You are very quickly drawn into the gangbanger experience, and there's a gritty, almost squalid feel to it at first. It's a very reactionary experience, and you soon start to develop feelings for the gang members you're working with. There are some characters you like and others you don't, and the action unfolds in the tried and trusted GTA fashion. Multiple threads open up that pull you through the linear story, but they are presented in such a way that the illusion of freedom is always very pronounced. The first couple of hours introduce you to the most obvious gameplay features, as well as some of the key players in the story."", ""Very early on, you'll notice that the combat system has been improved. If you've played <strong>Manhunt</strong>, you'll know pretty much what to expect. Shooting is done with the aid of a lock-on system, as is hand-to-hand combat, and the lock-on is, for the most part, fairly reliable. Tap R1 to get a lock and then hit L1 to open fire. It's fast and effective, and it rarely devolves to the frustrating depths that you no doubt experienced if you played Vice City."", ""Also, by the end of your second hour, you will have started to put your mark on your own personal CJ. You'll have been introduced to the barbershop, the clothes stores, the tattoo shop, and the gym, as well as the restaurants in your neighborhood. That's enough to be either fat or skinny, well dressed or a slob. You can even sport a huge moustache, if you're so inclined. You'll also start to notice that you're forming quite a bond with the game's hero. Examine this emotion further and you'll touch on one of the least quantifiable, but arguably most significant, aspects of San Andreas, CJ himself. Without wishing to get all beard-strokey and film studenty, I think it has to be said that CJ is possibly one of the most well-developed and believable videogame characters ever made. He's not a caricature, he's not a superhero, he's not a lone warrior out for justice: He's just a guy. Sure, he's a criminal, and he has a propensity for being particularly unpleasant, but very quickly, you start to notice that you really like him. It's not the same way you like Sam Fisher or Solid Snake or Ratchet, there's not the detachment that you have with those guys. With CJ, you like him because you very quickly start to feel like you really know him. Part of this is because of Young Maylay's surprisingly fantastic performance as CJ, but it's mostly because his reactions are credible. When he's making smartass remarks, they're casual and not forced. When he's dealing with a crazy character, his discomfort is tangible, and when you factor all of this in with your ownership of every facet of his development, you really start to notice a bond forming. By the time you leave Los Santos at around the nine-hour point, a lot of things have happened. The gang activities have escalated to a point where they're becoming almost oppressive, you will have experienced a number of set-pieces that are truly spectacular, and you will have touched on quite a few of San Andreas' gameplay styles. Running, driving, shooting, drive-bys, sneaking, and variations thereof will have been supplemented with some on-rails shooter sections, object collection, DDR-style dancing, Track & Field&#226;&#128;&#147;style button tapping, and several different kinds of racing. All of them are done in moderation, and none of them are so pronounced that you'll become frustrated. If you're lousy at rhythm games, you have to endure something of that style only twice in Los Santos. For me, bizarrely, the big hang-up was the racing. For someone obsessed with racing games, the fact that I struggled so badly with one of the major Midnight Club-esque races in the game utterly bewildered me. This was worsened by a returning GTA frustration -- the repetition involved if you keep messing up a mission. The race in question was against a Mexican gang using lowriders (not the best-handling cars in the game), and the process involved tracking down a lowrider, heading to Cesar's (CJ's sister's boyfriend's place), following him to the race location, and then entering the race and having to win. The race itself weaved through a considerably large part of the city, and if I made a mistake, I had to go all the way back to the beginning of that process. By my third attempt, it was starting to piss me off."", ""Once you leave Los Santos, you're actually quite glad to be away from all the gang-related crap that's going on. Being dumped out in the middle of nowhere in a small town in the countryside has a dramatic effect on the way you feel about the game, and the sense of being in the open air is actually quite refreshing. The missions in the wilderness have a very different vibe, and the characters you come across are far less intense (for the most part) than the bangers in Los Santos. Missions in the countryside vary from small-town bank jobs to torching an entire field of weed, and these are interspersed with a lot of off-roading over beautifully rendered landscapes. I spent about six hours working through the missions out there, and just as the game clock ticked over 15 hours, I was approaching San Fierro, and another major shift in terms of atmosphere."", 'There\'s a strong thread of humor running throughout the game, as there has been in every GTA, but you really start to notice it once you\'re traversing the hills of San Fierro. It\'s here that you encounter your geeky sidekick, Zero, voiced to perfection by David Cross, and his excruciatingly difficult side missions (remember the RC missions in Vice City? They\'re back, and they\'ll kick your ass). You\'ll also meet the Chinese triad boss Woozie (my favorite character in the game, in part thanks to the wonderful interplay between him and CJ) and Jizzy (voiced by Charlie ""I\'m Rick James, bitch"" Murphy), the proprietor of the strip club The Pleasure Domes. Your time in San Fierro feels somewhat more civilized than the time you spent in Los Santos, probably because you\'ve broken away from the gang scene to a certain extent and become much more of a player in the broader scheme of things. You now own property, and as you accumulate funds, you can buy a number of different places around the city that provide you with easily accessible safe houses, as well as new business opportunities. Your legitimacy is further compounded as you start to feel like you\'re taking a side in a much broader story. <p align=""center""> <table bgcolor=""#666666"" border=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" width=""540""> <tr> <td> <table border=""0"" cellpadding=""8"" cellspacing=""1"" width=""540""> <tr> <td bgcolor=""#ffffff""> <img align=""left"" height=""224"" hspace=""10"" src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/videogames/partner/1up/reviews/1265190"" vspace=""5"" width=""320"">', '<span style=""color:#666666; font-weight:bold; font-size:14px; font-family:verdana;""> Family Business </span>', ""The core San Fierro missions are all a lot of fun, and the eight hours I spent in that city seemed to fly by much faster than those spent in Los Santos. When you reach the Badlands, you're again faced with a change in vibe&#226;&#128;&#166;now you're out in the desert: It's very dusty and dirty, there's a lot of off-roading, and eventually a lot of flying, which I found particularly difficult. I think this has to do with the sudden change in gameplay style. After you've been cruising around in off-road vehicles and running around shooting at stuff, the controls of a WWII fighter plane or an attack chopper seem spectacularly sensitive, and you'll find yourself lurching around all over the place and failing miserably to meet any of the flying objectives until you become more subtle with the analog sticks. Here's a tip: switch the camera to a first person view as it makes life much easier."", ""Progress through the desert is extremely focused and driven exclusively by tasks set for you by Mike Toreno, played with typical ferociousness by James Woods. Some of the big gameplay surprises start to emerge out in the desert, and by the 25-hour point, when you leave these dusty environs to meet up with Woozie, who has now moved to Las Venturas, you're really starting to wonder what else the game could possibly dish up. Surely, by this point, anything it's going to do, it's already done, right? Wrong."", ""When you arrive in Las Venturas, the first thing you do is walk into a casino, where you're faced with a variety of different minigames, from roulette to slot machines.

There are literally hundreds of things about the game that I've not touched on here, but pretty much all of them are just as rewarding as the things I have discussed. All that remains is to tackle the question we posed at the beginning of this review: Is it really the best game ever made? Quite possibly, yes. Those of you with a sensitive disposition may find aspects of it objectionable, and those of you too hardcore to enjoy anything will no doubt find enough things to complain about to fill a million message board posts. A game of this scope and magnitude cannot help but attract attention, and it probably has more to live up to than any game in history, save for maybe <strong>Half-Life 2</strong>. In a lot of ways, this story would have been more interesting (and certainly more sensational) had I been able to declare that Rockstar had finally bitten off more than it could chew, and aimed too high with this final part of the PS2 trilogy. Thankfully, that's not the case though. It really is a remarkable achievement. </div>""]"

Even more than competitive shooters, multiplayer survival games rely on integrated voice to facilitate interesting, coincidental experiences between faceless strangers. Its an essential social tool, and one that can defuse the natural tension that spikes when you and another survivor come face to face in a barn, an abandoned post office, the woodswherever.\n\nA non-functional slider for adjusting communication volume implies that some form of voice is coming, but in the meantime The War Zs proximity text chat forces you to pull your hands off your mouse and WASD to type, leaving you defenseless. Its unforgivable that Hammerpoint is willing to sell The War Z in this state. The UI element that displays global, clan, and proximity text is a clumsy, immersion-breaking container, too: unless you hit F12 to disable the whole HUD, enjoy watching a steady tick of chat room gossip that you cant turn off individually.\n\nI wish that the only audio sins committed by The War Z were against your microphone. Theyre not, though. Every sound feels homemade in the worst way, or pulled from some public audio library. Whatever virus afflicts the zombies has given them the gentle feet of fairiesother than their grunts, zeds are completely inaudible when moving. In most situations, players dont make footstep noise either: theyre inexplicably silent on dirt, dense grass, urban outdoor areas, and pavement, except when sprinting (and even then, whisper quiet). But you will hear the clanking, oddly metallic thud of human feet when you or another survivor are moving on indoor surfaces or say, an empty shipping container.']"

Players jaded by performing the same moves with the same characters for years, take note: Capcom managed to put it all together in Street Fighter Alpha 2, creating a fantastic fighting package that mirrors the arcade version. <P>Alpha 2 contains the same eclectic mix of old-school Street Fighter characters, a few Final Fight characters, and a couple of totally new creations - including the old Russian brawler Zangief; the mystical Yoga master Dhalsim; Street Fighter 1 alumnus Gen; grenade-tossing Final Fighter Rolento; and Ryu's biggest fan, Sakura. Toss in the three hidden characters from the first Alpha (Akuma, Dan, and Bison), and you've got a fine selection. <P>The graphics in Alpha 2 are the best the Street Fighter series has ever seen. They approach cartoon-like clarity, right down to facial expressions. The sound is right on, and the music is festooned with arranged versions of classic Street Fighter tunes. <P>The gameplay has been tweaked from Alpha 1. The designers removed the simple-to-do chain combos and replaced them with custom combos, which allow your fighter to go absolutely insane for a short period of time (and dish out heavy-handed pain with lightning fast attacks). Super combos remain the same as the previous Alpha, with three different levels for each attack. <P>Though Alpha 2 may be the same as the rest of the Street Fighters, its high gloss graphics, sound, and gameplay really make this a near-perfect fighting game. 3-D fighters may be the future of the genre, but Alpha 2 proves that 2-D fighting can at times be better than its polygonal brethren. --Jeff Gerstmann <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

205,Breath of Fire III,"[""Breath of Fire III is a role-playing video game developed and published by Capcom originally for the PlayStation console as part of the Breath of Fire series. It is the first game in the franchise to feature three-dimensional graphics and voice acting. The story takes place in a fantasy world where humans live alongside anthropomorphic creatures, and centers the story on Ryu, the last of The Brood (a race of people who can transform into powerful dragons), as he searches the world to uncover the mystery of his people and reunite with his surrogate family. Ryu's journey takes him into adulthood where he is joined by a number of other characters who aid him in his quest. Breath of Fire III is notable as being one of the few RPGs that don't feature a major villain in its story, only having minor ones for some of the game's segments."", 'In most role-playing games, the player finds himself in the role of an adventurer who, sooner or later, must meet and defeat a fire-breathing dragon. But in a nice change of pace, Capcom\'s new RPG Breath of Fire III allows you to be adventurer and dragon all rolled into one.  <P>You play Ryu (or whatever you want to call him - the game leaves it up to you), the last of a race of beings who once sought to rule the world. A dragon that appears in the form of a young boy most of the time, Ryu travels the globe in a quest to reunite with two friends. But as his journey unfolds, he uncovers the truth behind their disappearances, as well as a larger plot of unspeakable evil - one that only Ryu can stop.  <P>RPG fans have heard this kind of story before, and in many respects, they\'ve played this game before. Breath of Fire III has all the standard RPG trappings: the ""you hit me, now I hit you"" combat engine, control over a multiple-character party, and a number of smaller quests you have to accomplish along the way to finishing the overall one. This is not necessarily a criticism. Innovation is none too common in the world of RPGs, and even ""cutting-edge"" examples such as Final Fantasy VII stay pretty much within the narrow path beaten by their predecessors. But Breath of Fire III does bring a few fresh offerings to the table, such as its ""examine"" command, fishing minigame, masters\' apprenticeship, and, most notably, its dragon gene system.  <P>The examine command is an option you can choose for any or all of your characters during battle. It instructs them to watch their enemies as they perform specialized attacks - and if they\'re lucky, pick up the attack as their own, which often comes in handy in later battles. Whenever you decide to visit a fishing spot, a fishing minigame provides you with the chance to catch different status-enhancing fish (eating a rainbow trout restores magic points, blowfish cure poison, and so on). It\'s kind of fun and doesn\'t take up too much time, making it pretty much like any other minigame found in a RPG, but hey, it\'s fishing! Apprenticing to one of the world\'s masters entails different requirements for each master, such as providing a certain item, money, or nothing at all, and pays off in status bonuses that sometimes take away a few points from other areas as well. When it comes down to it, it\'s just another way to build up your characters, though the variety\'s nice.  <P>The dragon gene system is one of the most notable features of the title. Instead of just turning into one dragon, Ryu can become every dragon by combining different dragon stones found throughout the game. The more powerful the form he takes on, the more magic points get sucked up each round of battle, and the more quickly he reverts back to boyhood. The key is to find the right balance of strength, breath attacks, and stamina. With 18 stones in all, you can spend a lot of time experimenting with different combinations and effects. <P>Graphically, Breath of Fire III straddles the line between 2D and 3D, with sprite-based graphics in an isometric 3D environment. The effect breathes some life, if not fire, into the traditional RPG look, sort of like Konami\'s Suikoden with a greater feeling of depth. It\'s an interesting attempt, but the style is a little too cartoonish for my liking. The soundtrack is above average, with a variety of tracks ranging from the expected epic style to what\'s best summed up as ""RPG lounge.""  <P>Not everything is right in fantasyland though, since the game has a habit of forcing you through needless, time-wasting sequences. Random encounters happen far too frequently in Breath of Fire III, somewhere within the beat of every 30 seconds when in a hostile environment. While you can often flee, this severely inhibits your desire to explore your surroundings and gives the game a Beyond the Beyond-like quality. Also, having to build characters up inch by inch over hours of beating up weakling monsters so that your party is strong enough to survive a big fight can be extremely tedious and boring. While there are certainly plenty of things to do in the game and it\'s quite long in terms of the number of play hours, much of that time is less enjoyable than it should be. If the examine command were a little easier to pull off successfully and the frequency of random encounters turned down a notch or two, many of these problems would be solved.  <P>Even with its handful of new features, Breath of Fire III breaks little new ground. Die-hard RPG fans may find it entertaining, but those looking for something new in this increasingly static genre will come away disappointed. --Joe Fielder <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Four characters (Psylocke, Wolverine, Juggernaut, and Magneto) return from Capcom's previous comic-based fighter, X-Men: Children of the Atom. New characters include Captain America, Spider-Man, Iron Man, Hulk, and more. It was an exciting arcade game, but the PlayStation version lacks any real punch and falls flat by comparison. <P>The game differs from the pack via its inclusion of gems that litter the landscape. You can pick up the gems and use them on command, resulting in brief power-ups to the character's speed, power, life, etc. Other than that, it's just basic Street Fighter action, complete with fireballs, dragon punches, and the like. The arcade version was a great game and differed enough from the Street Fighter and X-Men games to be entertaining. The PlayStation version has virtually the same gameplay. <P>Graphically, MSH looks all right. The characters and backgrounds are large and colorful. But the game also produces an awful lot of slowdown, and it's missing quite a few frames of character and background animation. The slowdown is even more apparent when picking larger characters such as Juggernaut and Blackheart. The music in MSH is fairly good and the speech is nice and crisp, unlike the Saturn version, which produced tinny, annoying sound effects. <P>The PlayStation version of MSH is tolerable, but it lost the arcade game's soul in the translation. The missing frames and slowdown don't help much, either. While I found the arcade game a blast, this version just seemed dull and boring. Whether this can be attributed to the translation itself or the fact that several, mostly better, Capcom fighters have been released in arcades since Marvel, I don't know. Rent it first and see if it's your thing, and for all of you who own both a PlayStation and a Saturn, you're slightly better off getting the Saturn version, as it doesn't slow down as much, has better color, and more frames of animation. --Jeff Gerstmann <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

218,Newman Haas Racing,"['The highly detailed and super-realistic Formula 1 engine has been striped down and completely rebuilt for the specifics of indy car racing. Developed in association with the Newman/Haas Racing Team.', 'True to its real-world inspiration, Newman/Haas Racing provides brilliant moments of racing euphoria separated by vast stretches of relative monotony. In their quest for realism, the designers have succeeded only too well, creating a game that is sure to please hard-core Indy Car fans but that may soon have casual gamers heading for the exits. <P>Newman/Haas presents racing in its purest form - no power-ups, shortcuts, or weapons here - and playing it requires equal parts patience, skill, and raw endurance. Those looking for an authentic Indy Car experience are in luck, as this is a game of remarkable depth and customizability. It offers a mind-boggling array of options - digital or analog control, single- or dual-player racing, four levels of difficulty, eleven tracks, 16 drivers, and a partridge in the pit stop. OK, I\'m kidding about the last item, but it\'s obvious that Psygnosis doesn\'t think Indy Car racing is a laughing matter, and it\'s gone to great lengths to make Newman/Haas as realistic as possible.  <P>Nowhere is this more evident than in the ability to customize one\'s car - you can select your transmission type, front and rear wing heights, tire pressure and compound, gearing and spring settings, and more. (Sure, you can just as easily ignore all these choices and just race the damn car, but who knows what competitive advantage you might be missing?) There are so many options that it\'s easy to spend as much time tweaking and testing your car as you actually do racing it. Factor in how long the races in Newman/Haas can be (try 20 minutes or so just for a standard qualifying round), and it\'s safe to say that any Indy Car fan willing to explore this game fully will be doing so for many hours indeed. <P>But will they be having fun? The answer is probably yes, because underneath all of the simulation components, Newman/Haas is a reasonably solid racing game. True, the graphics aren\'t going to win any awards - pop-up is pervasive, the texture-mapping primitive, and the frame rate somewhat inconsistent - but this is par for the course for ""real world"" racing sims. The sound effects also leave something to be desired - the in-game commentary is as repetitive as it is irrelevant, and the whine of the engines is tinny at times.  <P>But it\'s the controls that make Newman/Haas worth playing. They have a certain tightness and responsiveness to them that makes navigating the track a real joy, especially when using the manual shift option. Combine this with the challenging track layouts, which with the exception of a couple of oval courses demand respect and reward careful study, and you\'ve got the potential for some serious racing excitement. <P>And, at least occasionally, Newman/Haas delivers on that promise. Couple your finely honed racing skills with in-depth knowledge of the track - downshifting at just the right instant, taking the perfect angle on a curve, or turboing ahead of your opponent as the finish line approaches - and you\'ll experience a moment of genuine exhilaration.  <P>But unfortunately, these moments are simply too few and far between. All the options in the world can\'t change the fact that at its core Indy Car racing is all about driving around in circles, often for hours on end. Newman/Haas\' various modes - which include single races, four-race ""challenges"", or complete ten-race championship circuits - lend some measure of approachability for casual gamers, but we still think Indy Car racing is very much an acquired taste, one that will not appeal to most arcade-style racing fans.  <P>Indy Car devotees have probably logged off and bought Newman/Haas already, but for the rest of us, a qualifying lap on the rental track is definitely recommended. --Vince Broady <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

221,Rascal,"[""As the crafty kid hero designed by Jim Henson's Creature Shop you must save both your inventor dad and the entire planet from an evil overlord. Take on enemies from cunning pirates to Mayan gods and dragons. Hunt your way through 6 huge worlds -- from the Lost City of Atlantis to the Wild West -- with 18 action-packed levels."", 'Rascal is a visually confusing 3D adventure that is as entertaining as shopping in a crowded grocery store. It is another in a long line of 3D adventure games far below the Mario standard; this game proves dull and inconsistent. <P>Rascal is tasked with wading through six worlds to rescue his father from a bad guy, Chronos. I find it hard to imagine that a boy with a bubble-blowing gun could depose a master of time travel, but such is the premise. As advertised, there are 18 levels to the game (three to a world), but only 12 offer anything more than fighting with said bad guy. In each of those 12 levels you assemble an hourglass of six pieces, which teleports you back home. Each level\'s standard inventory is what you might expect: puzzles, critters, power-ups - not much left to the imagination. And much of the game is centered on merely picking up this stuff. Once Rascal makes it through all six worlds, the game is over. Anyone that has mastered jumping on mushrooms and shooting while running backwards could easily finish this game.  <P>Jim Henson\'s Creature Shop was assigned the task of designing Rascal the character. Sadly, it designed something quite similar to Atari\'s Paperboy. Rascal says little more than ""whoa"" and ""ouch"" as he saunters through many a blandly painted room. The soundtrack in the Old West and Hollywood levels and the random noise in many of the later rooms made me want to die. Luckily, volume is one thing you can control. This game has a few technical problems, too. Seams in between polygons, flickering animation, and pop-up occur regularly. The poor camera angle work makes the game impossible in spots, obscuring what Mario or Lara would see clearly. Objects behind Rascal prevent you from clearly seeing what lies ahead, because the invisible camera can\'t occupy the same space. In some places Rascal disappears for no reason other than camera malfunction. <P>There are a few levels in the Atlantis and Aztec worlds that are well designed, challenging, and cohesive right down to the music. The Paynal character is the rare visual standout of the ordeal, brightly colored and well animated. The high point of the game was several skateboard-styled half-pipes. They were fast, deadly, and fun. What\'s odd is the overall thrown-together feel of the game. The few outstanding levels are so good it makes me wonder if the developers cheaped out due to release date economics. Regardless, Rascal is a 3D adventure similar to Mario 64 or Tomb Raider only in ambition. --Sean Kelly <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

223,Time Crisis plus Guncon,"['<i>Time Crisis</i>, the shooter that redefined the genre, explodes onto the Play Station with a new mission--and a new controller. Fight the clock and shoot your enemies as you try to save hostages and minimize collateral damage. The action is fast-paced, and accuracy is all-important. The sleek black GunCon controller permits sharp shooting and creative dodging with a well-placed Duck button.', ""Namco's .40-caliber magnum opus, Time Crisis, has been nothing less to arcade gun games than what the Tekken trilogy has been to fighters: exceptional. In line with the company's home translations of the Tekken games, the PlayStation version is even better than the original. Time Crisis is a first-person polygonal railed gun game that stands apart from others in its genre by letting you duck behind obstacles to avoid enemy fire and reload. However, you can't hide too long, as an all-important time clock hurries you along, probably ending more games than bullets do. While not running quite as fast or as pretty as its System 22 arcade counterpart, the PlayStation version is an excellent translation of the coin-op, while containing an entirely new mission with multiple paths and endings. This addition not only nearly doubles the size of the game, it is even more fun to play than the original three-act run. The title is also packed with Namco's very own light gun, the GunCon (it came in ass-kicking black in Japan, but is gray with a bright red nozzle here), which hooks up to both the PlayStation and TV video output to guarantee accuracy within a pixel - a feature you'll find most necessary. While other gun games have a lot of slop, Time Crisis requires skill for its shots, especially in its higher levels where enemies hide behind large, and often moving, objects. The placement of the duck button near the mouth of the GunCon ensures that you hold the gun properly, dropping some knowledge down on junior gangstas everywhere (although it is possible to step on a second analog controller or a racing peripheral pedal to continue to Glock pose). The story to Time Crisis is, admittedly, pretty placeholder (in the first mission, you must rescue a foreign president's daughter, while in the second, you go after an arms supplier), but serves to set up conflict against a variety of deadly enemies. These range from standard drones, sharpshooters, machine gunners, bazooka men, and claw-wielding acrobats, to bellhops gone horribly wrong, helicopters, a cross between a tank and a crab, and even a blade-wielding fop. All in all, it's pretty brilliant. The only real drawback to the overall package is that the GunCon is only compatible with Namco shooters (the next one is the home version of Point Blank, due out in January) and Midway's Maximum Force. If you're looking for a really fun, really accurate gun game, this one can't be beat.  <I>--Joe Fielder </I><br>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

224,Deathtrap Dungeon,"['Includes game, original case, and manual. Game has moderate scratches but has been tested for playability. Case may have small cracks or flaws.', 'It\'s overwhelmingly sad how clones of Eidos Interactive\'s unmistakably successful 3D adventure title Tomb Raider are getting churned out for the Sony PlayStation. It seems like it\'s the new cookie-cutter genre of choice for gaming companies, just like 2D platform games were for the 16-bit console systems (Spawn, for example, is a repeat offender). However, in the midst of this rampant lack of originality, it\'s quite surprising for a 3D adventure game to arrive that makes you wish it were more like Tomb Raider.  <P>Such is the case with Eidos\' Deathtrap Dungeon, a title whose main differences from TR are the number of enemies you have to fight and its 3D camera - the first of which is very refreshing and the second, absolutely maddening. Backing it all up is a storyline that\'s about as involved as a video game needs to be: Once a year, a powerful wizard offers adventurers a chance to gain riches by surviving his deathtrap-filled dungeon. As either a big-boobed male or female warrior, you rise to the challenge. <P>It\'s a dungeon hack where you carve your way through scads of enemies (such as goblins, killer clowns, half-naked women with swords, four-armed monsters, and, oh say, maybe a Tyrannosaurus Rex), push levers to open up new areas, and try not to tumble into the occasional spike-filled pit. While the diversions are plenty, it\'s the game\'s perspective that keeps the game from being fun. Instead of a continuous behind-the-back view as in Tomb Raider, the camera frenetically moves about high, low, and side to side as you run around. There are even moments when you end up looking at your character\'s face when you\'d rather see what he or she\'s seeing. It\'s possible that the designers were trying to do something original and dynamic, but it would\'ve been much more preferable if they would have just stuck to a third-person perspective. If this was an attempt to showcase the graphics better, then it\'s even more of a failure. They have their nice moments, but there\'s no denying that the appearance of seams and pop-up is pretty frequent. <P>Graphical problems are one thing if they\'re purely aesthetic, but once they trickle into gameplay, that\'s a whole new issue. Whether linked to frustrating cameras or clunky level design, since enemies teleport into the levels, there are times when an enemy appears right around a corner and kills you before you even have a chance to see it, let alone attack. And beyond appearances, you\'ll die a lot, because ""live and learn,"" or rather ""die and learn,"" seems to be the name of the game. There are many traps that have to first be experienced to be avoided later, health potions are scarce on the early levels, enemies will often swarm upon you in groups, and your character is very slow to turn around if set upon from behind. Luckily, the load function is pretty quick, so you\'re not left gnashing your teeth for too long while restarting your saved game. <P>If all of these issues were fixed, Deathtrap Dungeon\'s heavy action element (slicing the goblins into little pieces is great - it\'s the perspective that really gets in the way) would qualify it as more fun than the Tomb Raider series. However, then the puzzles might fall toward the simple side, since the camera\'s trickery is quite possibly what makes the puzzles challenging in the first place. In the end, Deathtrap Dungeon turns out to be at the low end of games for the Sony PlayStation. It\'s not quite as good as Sony\'s Blasto, which it mirrors in that you can see how it could\'ve turned out to be a good game, but it\'s not nearly as bad as Sony\'s Spawn, where you just can\'t imagine what the developers were thinking. --Joe Fielder <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

227,Fighting Force,"['TAKE IT OUTSIDE! Fighting Forces delivers unparalled actions tons of attack moves in a fully progressive 3D environment.', ""Fighting Force, from the same developers that brought us Tomb Raider, looked very promising from the early reports. It looked like it was going to be the ultimate beat-'em-up game, redefining the genre for the 32-bit and up systems. Unfortunately, the game starts strong, but becomes an exercise in futility on or around the second level. <P>The game allows four character choices, each with its own strengths. Actually, it doesn't really matter which character you pick. They may have different attacks and throws, but they're all pretty interchangeable. The typical array of punches, kicks, and grabs are here. All the players also have a special attack that clears out all the enemies around them at the cost of a little bit of their life bar. Needless to say, originality is not one of Fighting Force's strong points. The game is basically a 3D version of Capcom's classic, Final Fight, except the characters and enemies lack the personality that made Final Fight exciting. Also, the use of a 3D environment causes a few problems. The most notable of these is that armed enemies have the ability to shoot you from off-screen. <P>Graphically, Fighting Force does the job. The characters move well and look detailed, albeit a bit blocky. The backgrounds are decent, but seem a little too static. Perhaps a little more animation could have been used to spruce the game's atmosphere up a bit. The sound doesn't help very much here either. It's tolerable, but that's about it. <P>Playing the game is simple, although it could have been a little simpler. Core chose to assign multiple tasks to a single button, even though there are plenty of free buttons on the PlayStation controller. As a result, trying to grab someone will sometimes cause your player to execute a reverse attack, leaving him wide open for punishment. This doesn't really matter, however, since you only really need to use one button to play the game anyway. In fact, you can even beat the game's final boss simply by walking up to him and pounding on the X button until he is dead. He will simply block your attacks, taking a small amount of damage each time you hit him. He won't be able to hit back, even with the game set on hard. You don't even have to bother looking at the screen. The rest of the game is pretty easy, although you'll have to actually walk around a little bit. The only neat thing about Fighting Force is that there are a few different branches of levels depending on which way you go. <P>All in all, I can't recommend purchasing Fighting Force unless you're prepared for an uninspired stab at making a 3D Final Fight or Streets of Rage. If you are an absolute beat-'em-up fiend, then check it out, but prepare yourself for an easy, flawed game. --Jeff Gerstmann <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

228,Ninja: Shadow of Darkness,"[""When an evil warlord sells his soul to rule feudal Japan, a young ninja emerges to battle the army of trolls, goblins, and evil spirits he unleashes. To defeat the warlord, you must utilize your fists, feet, and magical powers to traverse ten deadly levels, filled with merciless enemies and treacherous physical hazards. Unlike another recent ninja title, Activision's excellent Tenchu: Stealth Assassins, Eidos's Ninja: Shadow of Darkness makes no attempt at strategy; rather, it is an arcade-style beat-em-up that harks back to such relics as Double Dragon or Streets of Rage. Although the graphics are three-dimensional, the play mechanics remain roughly the same (walk right, kick the snot out of a couple of guys, walk right...). Core gamely attempts to mix things up by throwing in some wicked physical hazards, cool-looking ninja spells, and simple puzzle elements, but it's not enough to make Ninja more than a prospective rental. Although the game's dynamic camera does a good job of following the action, the control is stiff, resulting in numerous accidental deaths. Worse, your physical attacks are limited to simple kicks and punches; you can't even throw anybody! And you can forget about smacking somebody upside the head with a fire hydrant or an engine block (never mind the fact they didn't have fire hydrants or engine blocks in feudal Japan) like you could in another recent Eidos title, Fighting Force. At best, you may come across a sword or smoke bomb. Despite its best efforts, Eidos is cementing its reputation as a one-franchise company. A few more stumbles like Ninja: Shadow of Darkness, and the house that Lara built could come tumbling down as quickly as it was erected.  <I>--Gary Mollohan </I><br>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

229,WWF Warzone,"['NEW', 'Professional wrestling is huge. People who cut their teeth on the Rock and Wrestling era of the WWF are returning in droves, and the industry is doing better than it ever has before. Games based on wrestling have progressed through the years, and while WWF War Zone plays similarly to its predecessors, it presents a package that is completely unmatched in both gameplay and in atmosphere. <P>Most of the WWF\'s biggest stars are represented, including Steve Austin, the Undertaker, Kane, Mankind, the Rock, Triple H, and Ken Shamrock. Since the beginning of the game\'s development, Bret Hart, Ahmed Johnson, and the British Bulldog have left the WWF, but they remain in the game. A few hidden wrestlers are also in the game, most notably Mankind\'s other personalities, Dude Love and Cactus Jack. <P>There are several different modes in War Zone. The challenge mode is the game\'s main mode, putting your wrestler in a quest to win the championship belt. Along the way you\'ll be challenged to grudge matches by the wrestlers you\'ve wronged during your career. These grudge matches come in the form of the game\'s two other modes. Weapons matches are falls-anywhere, no-rules kinds of matches, where smacking your opponent with a two-by-four and suplexing him onto a table are the order of the day. The cage match forces you to beat your opponent, then climb out of the cage while he\'s too dazed to do anything about it. Once you\'ve won the belt in challenge mode, the game continues with you defending the belt against various challengers. There is also a really good tag-team mode that contains most of the four-man action from the real thing. Multiplayer modes include a free-for-all, cooperative cage matches, and tornado mode. There is also a comprehensive training mode, but it isn\'t as useful as the manual would have you believe. <P>War Zone plays, essentially, like every other wrestling game out there. But the control has been refined to a point of perfection, and a complicated tie-up system keeps people from doing cheap, low-damage moves over and over again. The game controls very tightly, and while you will do some button mashing to break holds and pins, it is kept to a minimum. <P>The graphics in War Zone are better than any other PlayStation wrestling game. Some of the characters (the Undertaker, for instance) look eerily like their real-life counterparts, although a few of the faces look a little weird. The sound effects are really good - all the grunts and screams were recorded by the real wrestlers. Also, all of the entrance music is in the game, although you only get to hear a few seconds of it during the game\'s lackluster ring introduction sequence. You can, however, head to the biography section if you feel the need to hear any of the music in its entirety. The two-man announce team of Vince McMahon and Jim Ross is good, but it sometimes gets a little bit behind the action. Also, there are only a couple of different sayings for the signature moves, meaning that you\'ll be hearing Jim Ross shout ""Stone Cold Stunner! Stone Cold Stunner!"" quite a lot during the course of the game. <P>WWF War Zone is long on gameplay and has a lot of atmosphere. However, it really could have used a little more atmosphere. The ring introductions are extremely short, and the cutscenes in challenge mode (all of which feature a really bad-looking polygonal woman and a limousine) are just plain stupid. The grudge match challenge clips are decent, but their lack of specific taunts makes them seem a little flat. Still, this is best wrestling package ever released and shouldn\'t be missed by anyone with even a passing interest in wrestling. --Jeff Gerstmann <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

For 1 of 2 players kid to adult.', 'Look up ""addictive"" in a dictionary of gaming terminology, and you\'ll likely find Taito\'s Bust A Move 2 listed with other time-wasting puzzle greats such as Baku Baku, Lemmings, and Tetris. It may be a little late for this classic to be rearing its head on another home system, but slight improvements over the PlayStation version as well as satisfying gameplay still make this one a worthwhile purchase for puzzle-game fans. <P>Bust A Move 2 takes its cue from Tetris, replacing the familiar patterned blocks with colored bubbles and letting you make the shots this time. In the game, the player shoots his or her bubbles up to a cluster of similarly colored bubbles, thereby eliminating that cluster. Three other variables make this general rule more interesting: a) Anything singularly attached to a ""popped"" cluster falls into the abyss, and b) Bubbles can be shot from a wide variety of angles and rebounded off walls. The fact that Bust A Move 2 requires not just strategic thinking, but also sharp aim, is what sets it apart and makes it addictive. <P>In Bust A Move 2\'s single-player mode, the player solves a series of ""puzzle"" levels, which get more complex as the game progresses. The game also offers a multiplayer mode where opponents can send death clusters to the other side if enough bubbles are dropped. <P>The Nintendo controller seems to adapt well to Bust A Move\'s gameplay. Besides being able to use either stick or D-pad for aiming, the programmers who ported the game to the Nintendo added the feature allowing the gun to be nudged slightly left or right with the L and R buttons. This inevitably makes more difficult bank shots a lot less frustrating. <P>Graphics are simple in Bust A Move 2, but they still keep things interesting. The frames of animation exceed those of the PlayStation version, making the game\'s weird winking bubbles and exploding clusters close to arcade quality. In fact, if you can block out the silly storyboard animation sequences and awkward backgrounds, playing Bust A Move 2 for the N64 is pretty close to having the stand-up version at home. <P>Bust A Move 2 is another puzzle game, true, but one that every puzzle fanatic who hasn\'t tried it should try. Acclaim\'s presentation of Taito\'s masterpiece is a nice nostalgic diversion for gamers who remember the stand-up version, and because it\'s easy to learn, it\'s a totally addicting game even for the inexperienced. --Tim Soete <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

You'd take Mad magazine's pointy-faced guys and run around a level, simultaneously planting traps for each other while trying to assemble enough items to leave the level? Trap Gunner borrows the basic premise of Spy vs. Spy, tosses in a storyline that looks like it was conceived about two hours before the game went gold, and brings it into a top-down polygonal world."", 'The story goes something like this: You pick a character and set out to blow up the rest of the characters, who have apparently all turned against Gain, the organization you all work for.

Thankfully, the poor writing doesn\'t get in the way or bog the game down in any way.', ""Once the game has started, you run around the level, planting traps as you go. If you crouch, you can see enemy traps and even disarm them. Most levels have spots where power-ups occasionally appear.

236,Kartia: The Word of Fate,"[""From some of the visionaries behind the <I>Final Fantasy</I> series, <I>Persona</I>, and <I>Soul Hackers</I> comes this strategy/role-playing game where players use magic to control their environment. <I>Kartia</I> is named after a card game that the game's characters use to conjure all sorts of magic. You'll freeze rivers, raise or lower ground, and clear fields to give your army a tactical advantage. And you'll also be able to create your own weapons, armor, and phantoms to go with you into turn-based battles--some of which comprise over 20 characters."", ""In <I>Kartia</I>, you'll choose between two characters whose unique, intermingling stories come to different endings. As a bonus, players can trade special items from the game with friends via a standard memory card."", ""Atlus is getting better at this. After finally bringing over the most recent PlayStation installment of its unique Megami Tensei series, Persona, it has become encouraged by the wide-open RPG market and begun porting over its best titles: Ogre Battle, Tactics Ogre, and now Kartia. <P>Originally titled Rebus (in Japan), the newly renamed Kartia refers to the card-based magic the game centers on. Similar in style to Tactics Ogre, Kartia is mainly a strategy game with a unique twist. Instead of concentrating so heavily on the tactical aspects of the game, Kartia focuses on creating phantoms, which are creatures that enter into battle with you. You can also use all sorts of elemental magic based on Kartia as well. During the game you will have the chance to create weapons and new kinds of phantoms. The variety found in Kartia is refreshing and the innovations abound. <P>You begin by choosing one of two characters, Toxe or Lacryma, and follow the story, which is different for each character. Like any decent RPG, the plot is lengthy and involved, and the game time invested in either quest will require significant commitment. Considering you can choose between two different characters adds considerable value. <P>With character designs by Yoshitaka Amano (of Final Fantasy fame) and game design by the producer of the Megami Tensei series, RPG fans will find much to enjoy here. Graphically, the game resembles a simpler Final Fantasy Tactics. However, the game is sharper, clearer, and more colorful than FF Tactics and much easier to navigate with an easy-to-see overhead perspective. Backgrounds are 3D and can be rotated 360 degrees, 90 degrees at a time. Characters are sprite-based and animated well for this sort of game, while spell effects give a good bang for the buck. <P>The sound effects are particularly sharp and add a tangible authenticity to the battle scenes. Gamers who enjoy well-done soundtracks will enjoy the orchestral compositions that lace the Kartia experience. An interesting feature that many gamers will enjoy is the versus mode, where you can take on a friend's army. You can also swap items with other players using your memory cards. <P>Perhaps the only downside (which is not unique to most RPGs, strategy or otherwise) is that the game is quite linear. Aside from that, battles tend to get a bit monotonous; however, the sheer number of options at your disposal goes some way to lightening that burden - small details to be sure and nothing that detracts from the game. Once past the first couple of battles, the subtleties sink in, and it's then that the game becomes a blast. <P>Considering the drought of good RPGs recently, Kartia's presence on the market is perfect timing. The fact that it's a good RPG makes it even better. Kartia's a game with substance and style, one that wins you over without resorting to flashy pyrotechnics or cheap gimmicks. Hopefully gamers won't overlook this game as they salivate in anticipation of games like Final Fantasy VIII. Kartia is a first-rate RPG that we're lucky to have on these shores. Atlus' daring move has resulted in one of the finest RPGs this year. --James Mielke <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Photo imaging of Martha's Vineyard, Chelan, Las Vegas, and realistic weather effects enhance the flying experience. Over 3,000 airports with famous landmarks are included. Players can learn the basics of flying through the in-flight tutorial, while the Flight School continue pilot's education through the advanced and complex details."", 'Competition is good. Microsoft Flight Simulator has long been the undisputed champion of the civil aviation sim scene, and the last four years\' worth of halfhearted upgrades led some to think that the flyboys in Redmond had given up even trying. Now, with two highly anticipated contenders on the way - Sierra\'s Pro Pilot and Looking Glass\'s Flight Unlimited 2 - Microsoft has proven itself fighting fit with a thorough retooling of the classic. <P> While flight scenery under standard hardware has been tuned, with a graphics accelerator card - the game supports Direct3D compatible cards - the graphics have become breathtaking, and it\'s no surprise that the illusion of flight is all the more convincing. Gone are the shimmer of distant scenery and the flicker of ground lights at night. Clouds are wispy and transparent, and the aliased patchwork terrain of earlier versions is now smoothly blended and vastly more realistic. Devotees will also notice more subtle graphic embellishments: Runways have skid-marks, and dawn really does now rise in the East. With the release of Windows 98, this version of Microsoft Flight Simulator will even support multiple monitors, making homemade wraparound cockpits a real (and, for spouses, terrifying) possibility. <P> Not only does the view out the window look better, there\'s more to see. Thirty North American cities are now rendered in detail, along with 15 others in Europe and Asia. Perhaps the most stunning is Hong Kong, which is faithfully represented right down to the checkerboard approach (which requires of pilots a last-minute sharp turn before landing). The Las Vegas, Hawaii, Japan, and Caribbean scenery expansion packs have been subsumed in this release, and the detail of the New York and Paris graphics exceed those of the retail enhancement add-ons. Microsoft has also made available a conversion utility for shareware scenery from earlier versions. <P> More than 3,000 airports are available for takeoffs and landings, but planning the flights in between is impossible without resorting to third-party tools; the ""database"" of navigational aids is merely a text listing of transmitters and beacons, and detailed area maps are provided only for the 45 major metropolitan airports. While this is an improvement upon the previous version - which offered no maps - it\'s still a notable shortcoming. <P> The stable of available aircraft has evolved to include fixed- and retractable-gear versions of the single-engined Cessna 182, the new Learjet 45, plus enhanced versions of the 737-400, Sopwith Camel, Schweitzer sailplane, and Extra 300S for aerobatics. For the first time, a helicopter is included: the Bell 206, which fixed-wing pilots will find an unfamiliar (and initially frustrating) flight experience. Instrument panels and controls are rendered in greater detail, right down to the realistic throttle knob on the Cessna, and the fully user-configurable keyboard layouts and joystick button assignments are a welcome addition. <P> The flight models of the aircraft are as realistic as ever, and Microsoft\'s association with FlightSafety International - a major training organization - will presumably speed acceptance of MSFS as a flight instruction tool. Included in the manual is even a coupon for a cut-rate first flying lesson from Cessna. <P> Other technical innovations include support for Force Feedback joysticks, bringing a new sensation to the PC flight sim. The experience is disconcertingly realistic - runways really are bumpy - and the rattle of the stick in a stall will send a shiver down your spine. Multiplayer support also returns, via LAN or the Internet (hosted free to players at Microsoft\'s Internet Gaming Zone). <P> Microsoft Flight Simulator 98 is an impressive feat. With a few exceptions, gone are the glaring flaws of the previous version; coupled with its technological innovations, the sum of the parts is a unique flight experience of unprecedented realism. Although the flight sim skies will soon be crowded, Microsoft Flight Simulator 98 will prove an able contender with the best of what the competition offers. <i>--Pete Deemer</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

243,Nightmare Creatures,"['small damage on upper right corner of label', 'Kalisto Entertainment\'s Nightmare Creatures originally came out for the PlayStation around Halloween of \'97. The game received high marks for atmosphere and design, but its overall score was brought down by control issues, a weak combo system, and occasional perspective problems. Now, a year later, Nightmare Creatures has come to the Nintendo 64, and while it\'s an almost identical game, the developers have gladly used that time to correct some of the title\'s flaws. <P>Nightmare Creatures sees 19th century London threatened by an onrush of gruesome beasts brought forth by the evil Adam Crowley (sort of a mix of the 1920s ""wickedest man in the world"" Aleister Crowley and The Muppet Show\'s Animal) and his sinister cult, the Brotherhood of Hecate. It\'s your job to wipe out these most unholiest of unholies and their master - either as the young American swordswoman Nadia or Ignatius, the ass-kicking monk.  <P>While Nightmare Creatures has been likened to a hybrid of Eidos\' Tomb Raider and Capcom\'s Resident Evil, that\'s not an entirely accurate analogy. The title takes place in a spooky 3D world that you view from a behind-the-back perspective; and that\'s where any comparison to either of the games pretty much stops. The game runs at a jaunty 30+ frames per second with up to four monsters simultaneously onscreen and with little or no slowdown. The graphics appear much crisper in the Nintendo 64 version, and the fog effects seen in the original look even more impressive here (the N64 can do fog in its sleep, which we\'ve all learned almost ad nauseam). <P>But catacombs and cesspools aside, the real mood setters are the monsters. You\'ll encounter 15 distinct types of creatures (ranging from zombies to giant spiders, dog-sized rats to werewolves, hellhounds to harpies, and three-headed ogres to flaming imps) and five different bosses, such as the Yeti, a four-headed fire-breathing serpent, and old Crowley himself. All the beasts have distinct powers and attack styles, making them quite a caliginous handful when an unpredictable, varied group pounces on your character all at once. <P>To combat these nasties, the characters are each equipped with a rudimentary sword or staff, which can eventually be upgraded to more lethal devices such as spiked clubs, double axes, and machetes. Beyond the basic wherewithal to attack these monsters in the first place, you also have a variety of fighting moves at your disposal. Additionally, there are quite a few power-ups to be found, such as single-shot and burst pistols, half and full healths, mines, fire bombs, and freeze and confusion spells. Besides the proficiency of the enemy creatures, there\'s an ever-dwindling adrenaline bar, which measures the amount of the natural stimulant in your system that must remain full to keep a Crowley-concocted poison from killing you. You can keep your adrenaline high only by continuously seeking out and winning battles. <P>And fighting the creatures can be a lot of fun, at least early on. They\'re very well designed, and their animations give them an eerie sense of life - and power-ups such as the razor (which lets you slice them in half or quarters) are quite a kick. In fact, you can lop off the monsters\' heads, and their bodies will often still chase after you. The problem here is that the fighting system is still fairly basic. While there are many moves for your character to use, they\'re very difficult to pull off, and many of them leave you open to attack afterwards. This causes you to quickly adopt a strategy of navigating creatures into corners and mashing on the buttons (triple pushes on A or B and going back and forth between them are actually some of the basic combos). The game is still fun, but having to use the same moves throughout gets a little old, though admittedly the different power-ups and new kinds of monsters keep it from getting totally dull. <P>One of the game\'s noticeable improvements however is the control. To begin with, the N64 controller handles the setup much more elegantly than the old-edition PlayStation pad, and the analog control is a dream. But the real design improvement is that during combat, the character is aimed at the monster he\'s battling. If he sidesteps, he\'s still focused on the creature. This can be a little problematic when you\'re trying to avoid a fight, though it\'s helpful enough during a fight to not be an issue. Not having camera control is still very frustrating during the boss stages (during the Yeti encounter, for instance, you have to line up just right to pick up items that are offscreen), but it doesn\'t really come up otherwise.  <P>Another nice touch to the game is that the designers tweaked the sewer stage to be much easier to navigate. In the original, you had to complete a number of difficult running jumps while avoiding/fighting several large, poly-tentacled monsters and not falling into the deadly water. The area now has a series of connected catwalks to run through - albeit with a few jumps - so the level is consequently much more enjoyable. Additionally, the having-to-keep-on-fighting-to-keep-your-adrenaline-going aspect seems to be less of a problem. Perhaps the creators have added or moved the enemies around so that you can recharge easier and thus explore the environment better. <P>It\'s really great to see a port of a game not make all the mistakes the original did, and it makes the title much easier to recommend. Nightmare Creatures still isn\'t a perfect game, but it now has enough going for it to be worth the time it takes to explore its dark, spooky world. --Joe Fielder <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

253,Might And Magic VI: The Mandate Of Heaven,"['This software is BRAND NEW. Packaging may differ slightly from the stock photo above.', 'New World Computing\'s classic Might and Magic games helped to define the subgenre that grizzled old RPG grognards now affectionately refer to as ""traditional style"" role-playing games. All of the previous Might and Magic role-playing games were set in expansive gaming worlds, filled with exotic locations, tomes of spells, armies of enemy types, and hoards of magic items. But during the past couple of years, such traditional role-playing games have been rarer than orcs in Denver. <P> The game takes place in the world of Enroth, a setting that will be familiar to veterans of the Heroes of Might and Magic spin-off strategy games. Good King Roland was apparently victorious in his battles with evil old Archibald, only to have his united lands fall prey to the ravages of an invasion of devils. When the King disappears after encountering the devilish horde, the ineffectual child prince Nicolai assumes control of the Kingdom. Your humble party of four adventurers has the onerous task of gaining the gratitude of the Kingdom\'s regional leaders, parlaying with a cryptic, omniscient Oracle in order to unravel the mystery behind Roland\'s disappearance and, along the way, carving a destructive path through a hellish legion of enemies. Welcome to the medieval jungle. <P> As with previous games in the series, Might and Magic VI is a first-person-perspective party-based game. In a minor break from Might and Magic tradition, all of your characters are human (elves need not apply), and there are only six available character classes.<P> Far more interesting is the game\'s character development system. Stomping monsters and completing quests will net your characters experience points. Gain enough experience points, and you\'ll be able to raise the levels of your characters, provided that you hook up with a capable trainer and have a few spare coins. With each increase in level, a character will gain a handful of points that can be used to increase that character\'s skills. Gain enough expertise in a particular skill, and you can train to become an expert and then a master in that skill, acquiring additional abilities in the process.<P> The graphics in Might and Magic VI are the best yet seen in a 3D first-person-perspective role-playing game. At one point in the game\'s development, hardware support for 3D graphics cards was contemplated, which certainly would have been welcome. But even without 3D acceleration, the graphics are generally crisp and clear, with a minimum of pixelation. Like prior games in the series, the graphics are also very colorful, which takes a while to get used to for those of us accustomed to somewhat more realistic, but considerably more dreary, depictions of our fantasy gaming worlds. <P> One of the best things about Might and Magic VI is that Enroth was clearly crafted with a lot of care and attention to detail. Although the game is huge, taking well over 100 hours to complete, each of the towns and dungeons was individually designed. There are tons of other little details that make Might and Magic VI special. You can fly like a Spitfire through the air and fire arrows at packs of monsters - miss them as they run by a stream, and your arrows will splash into the water. Go into a few too many shops without purchasing or selling anything, and you\'ll start to be rebuked by their keepers: ""See ya, tightwad!"" Walk into the right thieves\' guild, and you\'ll be confronted with a Monty Python-esque ""nudge, nudge, know what I mean, know what I mean...."" knowing glance from the trainer. A big metallic-looking guy loaded with vicious-looking swords who looks like a walking Ginsu knife is appropriately labeled a Cuisinart. There are some excellent sound effects as well - shoot a harpy out of the sky, and you\'ll be treated to the sound of it falling like a crumpled bird. Gargoyles shatter into pebbles. The sound of your footsteps reflects the nature of the ground you\'re walking on, whether it\'s hardened rock, fresh snow, or a damp beach. Music isn\'t used a great deal in the game, but it works well when it appears. <P> There are a few other minor disappointments. The interface is non-customizable, so you\'re stuck using the default key settings even if you find them inconvenient. Although it is basically a keyboard-controlled game, you still have to occasionally use the mouse, which is a bit cumbersome. The different geographical regions in the game don\'t quite integrate fully, meaning you\'ll occasionally be unable to loot the bodies of enemies that wandered outside of your current region. The main window for depicting the 3D gaming world is quite small, and even though there are hotkeys for all of the functions you need, there is surprisingly no ""full screen"" mode. The cutscene introduction is well done, but it feels somewhat disconnected from the rest of the game, and the introductory dialogue seems like it was scripted after the cutscene was already completed. Your interaction with the nonplayer characters wandering around town is quite limited, although you can get such NPCs to tag along to grant your party additional abilities, but such NPCs won\'t otherwise directly participate in the game. You might also be disappointed with the digitized character portraits, which sometimes don\'t seem to fit in with the other animated graphics. The voice acting of your characters is also of mixed quality, although I generally enjoyed it. Each of the characters has his own distinct expressions (""Chalk up another for the big guy!""), which is another nice touch. <P> There are also a few bugs and graphical quirks. There are occasional clipping errors, which allow you to see, or even interact with, objects through walls. Certain spells, like Meteor Shower will occasionally not complete their animations if they are cast on an enemy who is on sloped terrain, causing the game to hang. Switch the game from real-time mode to turn-based while your characters are on inclined terrain, and you\'ll gradually trickle down the incline (as will monsters similarly placed). Some spells don\'t seem to work as intended - I was never able to even momentarily ""Stun"" the most ineffectual of enemies.<P> But such quirks and bugs are really quite trivial. Overall, Might and Magic VI is a remarkably stable game - one of the most bug-free role-playing games in years. Even more importantly, it\'s tremendously addictive. There always seems to be one more quest you just have to complete, one more skill you have to elevate to mastery, one more region to explore... one more night to forget to sleep before dragging yourself to work. It\'s been a long time since a Might and Magic role-playing game was released, and many gamers questioned whether or not New World Computing could recapture the magic of past games in the series. We shouldn\'t have worried. Might and Magic VI is a classically designed role-playing game that features both a huge gaming world and lots of attention to detail. It\'s a standout game in what should be a great year for role-playing game fans. Might and Magic is back, and it\'s better than ever. <i>--Desslock</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Over 6000 km of freeways back streets roads alleyways and dead ends.  Complete freedom of movement; no fixed track - you choose where you want    to go.  Outrageous Hollywood style car handling.  16.7 million col"", 'It\'s hard to say why Grand Theft Auto is so much fun to play, since many people seem to get bored with it quickly. The simplicity of the gameplay might be one factor: You spend most of your time driving a little car through city streets, collecting points for committing crimes. It might sound like a good time initially, but for how long? For many, the answer will be ""not very long."" <P> So what type of gamer will enjoy GTA? Let\'s reflect on your childhood for the answer. First, did you like Hot Wheels and Matchbox cars a lot when you were a kid? Second, did you spend most of your time ramming the aforementioned toy cars into one another and lighting them on fire?If you answered ""yes"" to these questions, there\'s a good chance you\'ll enjoy . <P> But enough psychoanalysis. Sure, it\'s fun to cruise around the cities in GTA, running over innocent pedestrians and hijacking cars, then using them to crash into others for points. But your real purpose in the game is trying to get noticed by the local crime syndicate. To do that, you must successfully complete jobs for big points. Get enough points, and you\'ll advance to the next level and go on to other cities and bigger jobs. The more successful you are, the more difficult the jobs get. Some will be in multiple parts; others will have a time limit. And just because you work for the wrong side of the law doesn\'t mean you\'re safe from harm. Blow up a car with a rocket launcher while standing too close, and you\'ll be a crispy criminal. The life of crime is dangerous and risky. Even if you don\'t get killed or severely hurt, the cops will be after you all the time. <P> That\'s why patience is important. You can drive around recklessly all you want, but you\'ll constantly have the cops on your tail, interfering with your assigned job and the points you\'ll need to get to the next level. The easiest way to get the cops after you is by running over people or crashing into a squad car, and, unless you\'re sadistic, you usually run over people accidentally because of reckless driving. <P> It can take as long as two hours to achieve one million points and proceed to the second level. Later on, you\'ll need three million, which can take as long as five to six hours to achieve. This is somewhat frustrating because you can\'t save your game during levels. Since the game comes with a Windows 95 version you can multitask, so you don\'t have to tie up your PC playing the game, but if your system crashes, you\'re out of luck. <P> GTA is fun, and it has some excellent features. Vehicles all have appropriate physics. They steer, brake, accelerate, and handle like you might expect. Sports cars can stop and turn on a dime, but aren\'t very durable (if your car takes too much damage, it won\'t run properly and might even explode), while trucks have a large turning radius and take a long time to get up to speed, but are fairly durable. Small details - like the beeping sound a truck makes when it backs up, the various engine sounds, or the way pedestrians scream and run if you drive on the sidewalk - add to GTA\'s cool factor. <P> Once you get good at driving the cars, especially the fast sports cars, you can really zip through traffic. On roadways, if you gently tap the turn buttons, you can change lanes to avoid traffic without compensating for recentering the car, since it does so for you automatically. That makes a big difference when you\'re speeding down one of the multilane interstates. Another feature that really helps is how the perspective zooms in and out, determined by your rate of speed - it zooms in when you\'re going slow and out when you\'re going fast to expand your field of vision. The only flaw with this technique is that it doesn\'t always zoom in right away, so a tall building can block the view of your car until it does. <P> GTA is a good game that is highly recommended at a bargain price, but won\'t win any awards. Wanna-be sociopaths who can deal with the shortcomings will have a lot of fun, and if you could save games within levels, it would come even more highly recommended. <i>--Tasos Kaiafas</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

255,Azure Dreams,"['You are 15 years old. You are now of age to take on the role of ""monster tamer,"" a position your late father once held. In fact, your father was considered the greatest monster tamer in all the land. Your family name is legendary, and you have a lot to live up to. Your destiny is to enter the Demon Tower and retrieve the eggs of rare and exotic creatures, which you will then breed for companionship or to sell to the highest bidder. Such is the premise of Konami\'s newest RPG, Azure Dreams. <P>In the case of Konami, credit must be given where credit is due. Up until the time of the second generation of 32-bit games, RPGs had remained largely on the outskirts of most gamers\' tastes. It was a niche market defined by superdeformed characters, idiosyncratic Japanese overtones, and a sword and sorcery prerequisite that intimidated the average consumer. While 16-bit titles such as Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy III, and Super Mario RPG had been relatively successful, they were hardly selling as well as games like Mortal Kombat or Madden 93. So upon entering the 32-bit market, RPG fans had very little to choose from - Mystaria for the Saturn, Beyond the Beyond for the PlayStation, Shining Wisdom, and so on. So, while most people credit Final Fantasy VII for opening the floodgates for the impending wave of RPGs, it was really Suikoden that laid the groundwork. Despite its lackluster graphics, Suikoden\'s rich storyline and lengthy quest appealed not only to hard-core gamers, but to the novice role-player as well. It was so successful that Konami decided to translate its other 32-bit RPG, Vandal Hearts, almost immediately after Suikoden\'s release. Now, after the face of next-generation gaming has been permanently altered by games like Wild Arms, Persona, Dragon Force, Tactics Ogre, and Panzer Dragoon Saga, Konami has decided the time is right to release its most bizarre RPG to date. <P>Azure Dreams places you in the town of Monsbaia, where you assume the role of a youthful monster tamer, who, on the day of his 15th birthday, is eligible to enter the Demon Tower and search for monster eggs. The eggs that you collect may either be sold or hatched. If you choose to hatch them, you can then take these familiars into the tower with you to aid you on your journey. The higher in the tower you go, the more difficult it becomes to progress, but the eggs you will find will contain rarer and more exotic monsters. Monsters can later be fused into stronger creatures, which can be of great assistance later in the game. Unique to this sort of ""monster ranching"" is that the AI of each monster can be altered at any time during the game. For example, you can elect to have your monster travel behind you at all times, protecting you from attacks at the rear, or, you can choose to have the creature walk in front. You can also dictate whether it attacks enemies directly, remains on guard, or magically powers up your weapons with each attack. Unlike other turn-based RPGs, the fight sequences in Azure Dreams occur in real time, which gives the game a Zelda-esque feeling at times. As a result, the flexibility in the system is limited only by your own preferences, as the options are numerous. Another feature that keeps the game fresh is the random map generator, which creates completely new dungeon layouts each time you enter the Demon Tower. Your quest won\'t be short, however, since the Tower contains up to 90 different levels. <P>Once you attain a certain level of success from your monster-taming endeavors, you will be able to buy items that will enhance existing structures, while creating entirely new buildings as well. You\'ll be able to install a new theater, horse racing track, bowling alley, casino, and library, while improving your house, the hospital, and your monster hut, among others. You\'ll even be able to equip the interiors of practically any building with exercise machines, rugs, TVs, washing machines, etc. How you build up the town will go a long way towards influencing how much the residents like you. <P>During the game you will encounter a number of residents who will ask you to use your increasingly legendary prowess to help them with certain problems they might have. These miniquests add a large amount of variety to an already nonlinear game. With over 50 monsters to discover on over 90 different levels, Azure Dreams provides a considerable amount of replay value. <P>Graphically, the game is a bit rough. While characters are sprite-based, the backgrounds are fully polygonal and can be rotated 360 degrees. While the backgrounds look solid enough, the characters and monsters look really pixelated. Combined with a distracting method of providing transparent walls when traveling in the dungeons and a slightly awkward overhead view, Azure Dreams can be described as messy - colorful, but messy. Additionally, no one in the game has a shadow. Since this isn\'t an action/platformer, it doesn\'t cause any real problems, but it\'s a distracting detail nonetheless. The sound effects in Azure Dreams are functional, and while the soundtrack won\'t appeal to everyone, it manages to get the job done. <P>In all honesty, it\'s a surprise that Konami even brought Azure Dreams to the US. Its main character looks like a cross between Edward Scissorhands and Ronald McDonald and has a sarcastic attitude that\'s a far cry from most of today\'s cookie-cutter heroes. With each successive RPG, Konami has gotten bolder and braver. With an ever-increasing respect to the original Japanese source material, Konami has translated what could truly be termed a niche RPG. Straying from any conventional formula, Konami has created an RPG that\'s equal parts SimCity, Monster Rancher, and role-playing game. With a heartwarming story of discovery and companionship to boot, Konami has struck RPG gold again. Third time\'s a charm, apparently. --James Mielke <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

260,GoldenEye 007,"['N 64', '<i>GoldenEye 007</i> has been a huge success for Rareware, and it\'s easy to see why. More than a simple movie translation, this has earned its top-seller status on its own. Fans of <I>Doom</I> and <I>Quake</I> will recognize the first-person shooter perspective, but there the similarity ends. James Bond 007 has too much style to simply blast everything in sight and move to the next level. No, as 007, the player has a variety of different missions to perform, each with its own specific objectives. Each mission follows the <a href=""/exec/obidos/0792842723/${0}"">film</a> closely, and so James must use stealth and cunning as much as brute force. But if you see a Kalashnikov rifle lying around, by all means pick it up.', 'Controls are easy to master, which is impressive considering the variety of actions the onscreen hero can perform. James can run and walk at variable speeds, duck, pivot, hide, attach mines to enemy helicopters, block doors from opening, and more. The optional auto-aim feature is especially nice. Of course, James Bond is proficient in a wide variety of weapons. You get to use them all, from the trusty Walther PPK (with silencer) to double sets of full-auto machine guns.', ""The game's faithful tribute to the Bond legacy includes briefing dossiers on each mission, complete with wisecracks from Q and flirtatious comments from Moneypenny. And the 3-D representation of locations and characters from the movie is very impressive. The Rareware team spent time on the set with digital cameras, and it shows."", 'One of the distinguishing features of the game is the outstanding artificial intelligence of the enemies. When attacked, squads will rush to hit the alarm. If they make it, reinforcements come running. Enemy soldiers respond to being shot or blown up with chilling realism. According to Rareware, there are over 30 different animation routines that come into play, depending on where the soldier is hit. For those who prefer the challenge of human opponents, there are six clever multiplayer modes where up to four players can shoot it out, as teams or solo agents.', ""With excellent gameplay, intelligence, and style, <i>GoldenEye 007</i> is a first-person shooter that'll keep you coming back for more. <i>--Jeanne Uy</i>"", '<b>Pros:</b> <ul> <li>Built-in save capability for up to 4 players</li> <li>Auto-aim feature helps novice players feel like a sharpshooter</li> <li>Rich, complex game world filled with detail and variety</li> <li>Great bonus missions</li> </ul> <b>Cons:</b> <ul> <li>Sometimes cinematic scenes for fulfilling mission objectives are a bit anticlimactic</li> </ul>']"
261,Wargames: Defcon 1,"['When I first heard that MGM Interactive had a WarGames-related game in the works, I was totally excited. I wanted to take control of Matthew Broderick and hack into NORAD on a TRS-80. I wanted to ride around on the back of Ally Sheedy\'s moped as she carted me from school to home. I wanted to push a button that made the guy in the missile silo pull out a pistol and shout ""Turn your key, sir!"" Alas, this game has none of that. It is, however, an outstanding mission-based shooter. Think EA\'s Strike series, but with lots of different units. <P>Each of the game\'s 30 missions (15 as NORAD, 15 as WOPR) gives you a collection of units ranging from lightly armored jeeps to monstrous tanks, helicopters, and jets, and points you at stuff that you need to blow up. You control each unit one at a time, with the ability to switch between them at will. You do have the ability to call units to your location, giving the other units AI control, but the AI is so terrible that your units will have a hard time crossing a bridge, let alone fighting the enemy. Playing the game is quite simple. You just take a tank and start towards your next objective. Shoot anything that gets in your way, taking care to back up to dodge enemy fire. This, coupled with the fact that most of your units can take loads of damage, and that it\'s extremely easy to replenish your units, makes WarGames pretty darn easy. Two-player mode puts the game in a diagonal split-screen and has both head-to-head and cooperative modes. <P>Graphically, WarGames looks really good. All the structures and units (with the possible exception of the miniscule infantry) look very nice, and the terrain is well drawn. The terrain is also damaged during firefights, resulting in forest fires and other environmental chaos. The soundtrack is very military and drives the point of the game home. The effects are very nice, and the text scroll noise is directly from the old movie. The voice of Joshua also makes a small appearance at the title screen. <P>While WarGames: Defcon 1 may not have allowed me to relive one of my favorite films, it is still a solid game with a fairly good back story. Dabney Coleman may be nowhere to be found here, but once you get past this slight oversight (all games should feature at least one picture of Dabney), you\'ll discover a great shooter. --Jeff Gerstmann <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

262,Half-Life - PC,"['As Gordon Freeman, a young research associate in the Anomalous Materials Laboratory of the Black Mesa Federal Research Facility, your mission is to investigate a strange crystalline being. You find yourself battling not only the alien monsters but also the government troops sent in to keep the crisis under wraps. Sophisticated monsters and creative technologies make this game a winner.', ""A major goal in any game is to create the illusion of reality, a fact that is especially true for first-person shooters. The whole point of the genre is to put you, literally, in the role of the protagonist. In light of this, it's surprising that so many games have stuck to a blueprint that breaks the illusion at every possible opportunity, with text-based mission briefings, jarring level transitions, and weapons and power-ups scattered around like decorative furniture. But Valve Software has obviously spent a lot of time studying the mistakes of the past. The result is Half-Life, the closest thing to a revolutionary step the genre has ever taken. Through a series of subtle and artistic design decisions, Half-Life creates a reality that is self-contained, believable, and thoroughly engaging. And while it may be surprising that no game has utilized any of these ideas in the past, it's clear that any future shooter will be remiss to overlook them."", ""The plot of the game is typical (in fact, it's little more than an elaborate version of Doom). You are Gordon Freeman, scientist at the Black Mesa Research Facility, involved in some mysterious experiments. These experiments go awry, and foul creatures begin taking over the complex. It gets more complicated, but there's no need to ruin the surprises that await. Suffice it to say that Half-Life isn't a great game because of its story; it's a great game because of how it presents that story. From the opening moments of the game to the final showdown (and even beyond) all hell is continually breaking loose, and there is never a moment where you are not seeing things through Freeman's eyes. There are scripted events in the game. There are opening and closing scenes. But they all occur naturally within the game environment. It may sound simple, but it goes a long way toward helping create a believable world."", ""Weapon, ammunition, and health placement follows the same philosophy. You'll hardly ever come across an item that is just bobbing and spinning in place like some gift from the heavens. Valve has done a good job of justifying the typical health and armor meters. Freeman is wearing a hazard suit, used by researchers involved in dangerous experiments. To regain health and armor energy, you must fill up at power stations. These are almost always located in logical places, usually near areas where dangerous work would be performed. There are no power-ups to be found. Weapons and ammo are taken from supply closets or the corpses of fallen security guards and soldiers. Even the more experimental weapons have their proper place - in the weapons research department of the facility. And late in the game, once you've left the research facility, the supply of ammo and first aid kits is believably scarce."", ""There are no levels in Half-Life, or, more specifically, it lacks the concept of levels and episodes we've come to expect. The game is a continual stream of locations from beginning to end. You can move back and forth at will (with only a few exceptions), as can those who are pursuing you. And though the brief loading time between zones is the one artifact that breaks the flow of the game, the transitions are thankfully brief."", ""The attention to detail doesn't just stop with the basic structure. The game is full of surprises, continually throwing new obstacles and challenges in your path. There is a wide variety of textures, lending a distinct look to every area. The numerous scripted events bolster the illusion of reality, and you'll come across detailed scenes that are continually suspenseful. The gameplay is very puzzle-oriented, but the puzzles hardly seem to be superficial obstacles. Whether you're repairing a reactor or finding some way to dispose of a massive locked door, the puzzles always seem plausible in the world Valve has created."", ""The alien enemies are well designed and occasionally border on the terrifying. From the basic headcrab (which resembles a cross between Alien's facehugger and X-COM Apocalypse's brainsucker) to monstrosities a hundred times its size, the enemies truly look like organic beings. There are human enemies in the game, and these display a level of artificial intelligence that is remarkable. While many a game's idea of excellent AI is simply monsters that can make it through a doorway to follow you, Half-Life's antagonists act in a manner that is frighteningly realistic. They won't follow you through a doorway - they'll just lob a few grenades to where you're hiding and be done with it."", 'The weapons look and sound great, ranging from the realistic combat shotguns and grenade launchers, to the science-fictional, high-powered particle accelerators. The level design is diverse (owing a nod of thanks to Jedi Knight), including the expansive research facility, some great outdoor areas, and foreign locales that are best left to be discovered on your own. Suffice to say, it never gets repetitive.', 'The only problems with Half-Life are the results of it being so ambitious. The fact that all of the humans in the game look like clones takes from the otherwise realistic atmosphere. The diversity of the levels and puzzles will undoubtedly leave you thinking some areas were better than others. But complaints that arise are simply a reaction to the fact that the game is so close to ideal. Half-Life is an exceptional single-player game and a solid multiplayer game (though the upcoming Team Fortress add-on may make it even better). It takes the tried-and-true one step further but ends up leaps and bounds ahead of the rest. <i>--Ron Dulin</i> <br />--<i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

263,Unreal (Jewel Case) - PC,"['You awaken in a small, enclosed room with metal walls. You have no recollection of where you are. Perhaps a prison cell? An angled metal door lies ahead. With effort, you push the creaky slab open. This is not at all what you expected. The ""prison"" you just exited is now revealed to be a small, badly damaged spacecraft. Walking along a trail in foreign terrain, gun in hand, you journey onward to find out where you are and what your purpose is here. Observing your surroundings beyond the carnage reveals a beautiful and serene, yet somehow spooky, landscape. Two moons are in the sky. Ruins are in the distance. And a big, bad alien is eating one of your buddies. <I>Unreal</I> places you in a stunningly lifelike 3-D world that is as dangerous as it is beautiful. Whether playing alone or on the Internet, <I>Unreal</I> will change your perception of what computer games should be.', ""The difficulty in reviewing a game like Unreal is keeping in mind what has come before it while at the same time allowing the game to flesh out its own sense of style and gameplay. Unreal is not Quake. The look is different. The feel is different. And what gives Unreal an edge is how these differences, while not always positive, distinguish it from the legions of other 3D shooters. <P> In Unreal, you are a prisoner aboard a ship en route to a penal colony. The ship crashes on a mysterious planet where the mystical Nali race is being subjugated by the cruel and technologically advanced Skaarj. As you journey through the many environments on the planet, you must find a means of escape from the planet and help the Nali defeat their oppressors. Unreal intertwines the feel of the medieval Nali architecture and culture with the sci-fi design of the weapons and the Skaarj warriors to create an environment that's a step above other games of its ilk. <P> As far as the game itself, the graphics are incredible. Unreal has the best graphics of any first-person shooter - and possibly of any game - to date. The palette is bright and varied, while the textures are intricate and well defined. The quality of textures deserves high praise - they help create environments that really take hold of you. The levels are so detailed and distinct that it's easy to distinguish one level from all the others, and you won't confuse the prison spacecraft for the Nali village. In conjunction with the graphics, the level design is advanced and complex. The mix of wide-open spaces and cramped hallways is refreshing. As far as graphics go, you just can't beat Unreal's immersion factor. <P> Combining an alien world with weapons that seem alien themselves has produced some interesting results. As varied as the ten weapons are, there's also an alternate method of firing each of them (the 8-Ball Launcher, Unreal's equivalent of a rocket launcher, can also be used as a grenade launcher). This wide range of attack styles will undoubtedly produce higher degrees of strategy in deathmatch play. As for single-player, the weapon placement and location was spaced out evenly, and finding ammunition was not a daunting task. <P> One of Unreal's best features is the enemy AI. In other games, the logic of certain creature actions seems to be linear and undefined. In Unreal, each opponent attacks with its own style, using a combination of melee and ranged attacks. One of the most impressive experiences (if not the most aggravating) was seeing a well-placed rocket shot miss because a Skaarj dodged it at the last second. Another eye-catching sight was watching different enemies power up shields to protect themselves in the midst of battle. <P> As far as problems go, there are some, but they don't hurt gameplay enough to reduce the overall experience. The first is that there are too few enemy model types. Unreal has only six main enemy models, but the design team has done a pretty good job of using different skins to create a variety of opponents. In addition, there are other models for the random critters that you fight throughout your adventuring. <P> Another complaint deals with the pace of gameplay. Sometimes the pace of action seems too stretched out, and it feels as if each battle is just the same as the last. However, these gaps were few, and for the most part the game pacing and plot development were enjoyable. On the puzzle-solving side, there isn't much to be had; most of the game you simply push buttons to open a path leading to the next level. But your actions involving them are well integrated into the plot. There are few complex puzzles to solve; it's doubtful that Unreal would benefit from more in that area. <P> Lastly, the weapons are pretty cool, but there's no simplicity in design. Each gun takes some practice to understand its use and benefits, but in the end, you spend too much time learning. Rather than give you instinctual weapons (like a basic shotgun or machine gun), Unreal's unusual weaponry forces you to adjust the way you play, without much added benefit of weapon ferocity or visceral gratification. <P> If you're looking to hone your deathmatch skills, however, you're going to find playing online to be next to impossible. The developers have stated in the readme.txt file that the game is still in the tweaking phase as far as Internet play is concerned. But with seemingly boundless game customizability options as well as in-package deathmatch levels, Unreal gives you everything you need to practice for the big time. It even gives you a choice of bots designed by Steve Polge to test your mettle. This was probably one of the most enjoyable features, and after you've finished the game you can go in and set up your own games for a single-player deathmatch experience. <P> Unreal is a truly great single-player game. It's hard to say whether it will stand the test of the first-person action-shooter wars and become a classic in and of itself. It will definitely have to overcome the lack of a decent Internet experience if it wants to obtain any more accolades, but, apart from that, it offers as much as you could possibly want from a game in this genre. <i>--Tahsin Shamma</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Tee up, club selection, stance, hit point, and shot are the basic options available onscreen. Tee up lets you place the tee, club selection lets you choose your club, while stance lets you adjust your own positioning. Hit point lets you select the spot where you hit the ball, since hitting it lower on its surface will cause a higher arc with less distance, while hitting the ball on the upper part of the sphere will result in a line drive. Shot, as the name implies, finally allows you to drive the ball, while making even further adjustments. Not to say that this is a tedious affair, quite the opposite. Generally, if you choose to avoid the majority of the menus, you can simply go straight to shot and not suffer any detrimental consequences since the computer caddie selects the appropriate club for you anyway. While lining up your shot, a rainbow-colored arc indicates the likely trajectory of your ball, allowing you to make further refinements in your shot selection. While this may sound complex to some, it\'s really not, and might possibly be the one of the easiest golf games to just plug and play. <P>All of this golfing joy doesn\'t come without its downside, however. Through no fault of the N64\'s processing power, WCC has its fair share of shortcomings, the most obvious being the single course to play. Other not so wonderful factors include an almost aggravating sameness to each of the holes. Maybe once during the 18 holes will you get a change in the weather - usually a pathetic-looking attempt at rain that looks like a kid with a white crayon drawing all over the screen. The consistent sunniness (odd shower aside) of the game coupled with a rather bland game engine combine to make a fairly monotonous golf experience. All the holes look the same. Each progressive hole you start looks just like the last one, which tends to sap your incentive to play. Despite Nintendo\'s assurances that this game is fully polygonal, the characters are made up of digitized sprites, resulting in a pasted-on-the-screen look that some might find annoying. Unimpressive frame rates also conspire to hamper the proceedings, nothing horrible, mind you, but you would think the N64 had more to give than this poorly designed engine displays. Perhaps the least important but equally disappointing factor is the color commentary. You get two guys blabbing on, who sound like they\'re reading a children\'s book, to children. To call these guys dry isn\'t enough. You feel like you\'re listening to some kind of ""learn a foreign language"" tape. Try to avoid paying attention to these guys. It makes the whole thing easier that way. <P>Working in the game\'s favor are some neat little options such as the create-a-player feature, which lets you alter your player\'s attributes and even his clubs! Another handy feature is the Cartcam, which lets you explore the course in a virtual cart. While it does little to help you anticipate the nuances of the course - and actually highlights the games graphical weaknesses like flat cardboard trees and people - it\'s still an entertaining diversion. Think Duke Nukem 64 in a golf cart, and you\'re halfway there. <P>Despite the zits and pimples, Waialae Country Club is a competently designed golf game. Its only major downfalls are the lack of variety and the disappointing game engine. However, WCC\'s bad points are better than most other console golf games\' good points, so it\'s a fair trade-off. Throw in a golf bag full of picture-perfect gameplay, and you\'ve got an excellent alternative to doing the real thing. If you like golf and are dying to have a golf game for your N64, this game is recommended. Otherwise, like a trip to Honolulu, Waialae Country Club True Golf Classics is best appreciated as a short-term investment. Rental only. --James Mielke <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

273,Ultima Online: The Second Age,"['The bestselling role-playing series of all time has become the number one online game, <i>Ultima Online</i>. This revolutionary game allows thousands of players to exist simultaneously in the same fantasy world over the Internet. Players can enjoy true social interaction with other participants in real time--form adventuring parties, engage in battles, take on perilous quests, or chat in a tavern over a goblet of virtual wine. <i>Ultima Online</i> immerses players in a continuous, ever-changing game world, complete with day and night, light and shadow effects, 3-D terrain, and 16-bit color SVGA graphics.', 'My brother and I have been playing Ultima Online off and on since the early days of the game\'s initial beta test. We entered the online world of Britannia as wide-eyed adventurers, somewhat naive in our hopes of establishing a name for ourselves as heroes in the legendary lands of our favorite role-playing series. Over a year later, after playing and suffering through countless bugs, numerous deaths at the hands of player killers and server crashes, and a world gone mad with house building and grand-master titles, we are disillusioned, bitter, and even somewhat paranoid veterans. No longer do we log onto UO for the novel joy of participating in a truly unique gaming experience. Rather, we merely find ourselves reluctant to give up on characters that took so many months to whip into shape. That and we have to justify the fact that our credit card companies are nailing us for $10 every month. <P>When Origin announced Ultima Online - The Second Age, we looked upon the news with mixed emotions. On the one hand, you have an expansion pack that promises to add more lands to explore, more creatures to fight and tame, and more gameplay features to ease your suffering. On the other hand, you have a game developer expanding upon a game that still isn\'t quite where it should have been when it was released. To us, that seems sort of like declaring a foreign war to call attention away from domestic unrest. Still, we ventured boldly forth into the new lands, eager to encounter the challenges of this untamed realm. <P>Unfortunately, The Second Age makes a fairly awful first impression. After buying and installing the new software, you might expect to be able to move quickly and easily into the new lands. This is not necessarily the case. <P>Should you choose to enter the new lands via the Moonglow gateway (which appears to be the only gateway that takes you from a guarded location in Britannia to a guarded location in the new lands), you must first say some magic words. Of course, there is nothing in the game\'s printed manual or readme file about these words. You simply have to find them for yourself. So after what seemed like a lifetime of searching through files and asking for help from other players, we finally discovered the following: To move from Moonglow to Papua (one of the two villages in The Second Age), you must say ""recdu"" while on or near the teleporter. To return, you must say ""recsu."" Seems to us that a simpler method would be better - especially when you consider that this is the only one of the landlocked gateways that requires a password (why not make them all the same?). <P>After we made it into the new world, things improved somewhat. One of the new features in The Second Age is support for player-built cities. Because of this, the only premade settlements in The Second Age are relatively small and sparse. Delucia is a decent-sized town at the southwest corner of the rectangular world map, while Papua is a smaller town of grass huts closer to the center of the map. Someday, player-owned dwellings will fill out these towns and give rise to others, but it\'s a little too early to report fully on that aspect of the game. We\'re just hopeful that it goes smoother than the messy home building in Britannia. It often seems as if you can\'t take two steps in that world without running into somebody\'s house. <P>For the most part, the lands surrounding Papua and Delucia are much like those in Britannia. One notable difference is the abundance of wildlife and monsters - a major improvement over Britannia where creatures only seem to be regularly found near a handful of key, well-known respawn sites. In The Second Age, deer and other wildlife roam in large numbers. Monsters are rather plentiful and - better yet - well balanced so that players of all skill levels can find something they can handle. There are a few too many snakes (one of UO\'s most annoying creatures) and giant toads, but otherwise the monster population is quite good. Respawn rates seem to be much better in the early going, but that could just be the result of fewer players (predators) in the new lands. <P>The two new races, the snakelike Ophidians and the spiderish Terathan, are impressive and tough to kill. Both races include multiple types of fighters and mages, so you have to be careful to check which type you\'re actually fighting, lest ye get summarily whupped upon. Ostards are the new, rideable creatures, and they look a bit like a cross between a bird and a small dinosaur. Other new creatures include the mammoth Titans, a formidable Cyclops, a magic-wielding red mongbat (or imp), and a bunch of ice and frost variations of familiar UO beasties. While the monster population and respawn rates are much better than in the original UO, one other aspect of the new world is much, much worse than its predecessor. Simply put, the terrain in The Second Age is horrendous. The art is the same, but the layouts look very much like the work of someone who discovered the terrain editor and was unable to practice restraint. It is vastly overdone and unconvincing, with swamps, plains, mountains, and lava pits all thrown together without any sense of purpose. <P>The terrain design is made all the more annoying by the many oddities of the UO landscape that have carried over to the new lands: impassable wildflowers and mushroom patches, saplings that can stop a warrior where an Ettin can\'t, that sort of thing. These ridiculous terrain glitches have gone from being mere annoyances to obstacles requiring teleportation or long detours. According to Origin, there are areas of the new lands in which this was done on purpose, and (even worse) it was done to accommodate players who rely on ranged weapons and magic. So rather than free up as much space as possible within the tight borders of the new lands, Origin has instead packed the new lands with obstacles. <P>And with sections of the landscape purposely designed with ranged weapons and magic in mind - the offensive combination preferred by most player killers - Origin has actually tailor-made an ambusher\'s paradise of gullies, ravines, canyons, and unreachable sniping spots. This simply boggles the mind. One would imagine that Origin would take every step possible to eliminate (or at least severely curtail) the player-killing problem in UO. <P>UO\'s perspective problems have carried over to The Second Age as well, making it tough to spot a slope or a ridge, especially when it\'s covered with too much vegetation. To make matters worse, there are several spots where you can actually fall from enough of a height to wound yourself (resulting in a particularly startling scream from your onscreen persona). The nonsensical road system is equally annoying. In UO, a road is the only path that you know will (eventually) lead to safety. In The Second Age, many roads go nowhere at all (a real pain when you\'re trying to learn the route from Delucia to Papua) or lead to dead ends. Dead ends abound, in fact, which is an awfully frustrating state of affairs when you\'re trying to navigate these new lands on foot. <P>There have been mutterings about the new lands being based on a mysterious lost land from previous Ultimas. Even if this is true, we couldn\'t help feeling that the new lands were a bit contrived and tacked on. Why not have a ""new land"" that already was a familiar part of the Ultima storyline? Serpent Isle, for instance, or the Gargoyle lands from Ultima VI? Overall, The Second Age just feels a little forced and does not mesh well with the Ultima world. <P>On some of the more basic fronts, The Second Age gives us the big-window feature, which is actually now available to all UO players. This welcome new feature lets you arrange miscellaneous items (paper doll, backpack, etc.) around the border of the game window instead of on top of it. <P>Server load on the new lands varies pretty widely. At peak hours, you can\'t swing a dead mongbat without hitting a dozen other players (at least one of which always seems to be a player killer). At other times, the servers seem to be nearly vacant. Performance issues are still a concern, and lag still causes as many deaths as most monsters in the game, but in general we found performance in The Second Age better than in ""old"" Britannia. Time warps and server crashes still occur frequently, though not nearly as often as in the unstable days of UO\'s infancy. Also, morning players are still plagued by Origin\'s baffling backup system, which apparently stops saving data at around 10:30am but allows players to keep playing for another hour or so before taking the servers down for maintenance. Here\'s an idea: When the backup is done, take the servers down immediately or come up with an onscreen icon to indicate that the backup has finished, but the daily maintenance has not yet taken place. This way, players won\'t lose an hour or so of hard-earned advancement simply because they missed the fleeting ""The Servers Are Going Down Soon"" notice. <P>Still, The Second Age is a no-brainer for current UO players. At only $6.95 to upgrade, it\'s hard to resist the idea of an expansion pack that provides more room to breathe and more creatures to fight. Newcomers to the UO universe should be a bit more wary, however, especially with other games like EverQuest just around the corner. The Second Age adds some nice new features and fixes a few things, but it introduces a whole slew of its own problems. Does this mean that we won\'t play the game? Of course not. We\'ll still log on every day to bash monsters, gather gold, and build upon our reputations. That\'s just part of the love-hate charm of this addictive and frustrating game. But we had honestly hoped for more from The Second Age and, after all this time, from the state of Ultima Online in general. -- Michael ""Rackhir"" Ryan and Jeffrey ""Chingazi"" Ryan -- <i>Gamespot Review</i>']"

278,Croc: Legend of the Gobbos,"['Legend og the Gobbos, the crusading Croc rescues his peace lovong friends from the grasp of the evil magician rated everyone', ""Fox Interactive's Croc: Legend of Gobbos sees its player as a genuinely cute platform hero - something I never thought I'd ever say about a video game character - who must explore a 3D Super Mario 64-like world, in search of his kidnapped gerbil-esque friends, the Gobbos.  <P>Yep, that's right, the evil Baron Dante and his Dantini followers have stolen away Croc's pals and spread them out equally all over the world, so as to always have one around to harass if the need arises. Now it's up to you to run, jump, climb, and swim your way through 45 levels made up of forest, desert, ice, and Dante Castle stages, freeing the Gobbos from their PETA-unfriendly cages all the while. If you're really good and can make it to the secret island, there's a secret boss on a hidden island to beat, as well - making it, all in all, a handsomely sized game. It's just some of the gameplay that takes place over those levels that makes the whole thing a little questionable. <P>Croc can easily be seen as the sum of many previous video game parts. The character possesses the butt-stomp of Mario from Super Mario 64, the tail-spin and climbing ability of the same-named lead of Crystal Dynamic's Gex, and bits of Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog, as well. A few other games can be noticed at times, too. But that's all right if the game's fun, right? Sure, and it almost is.  <P>Without a doubt, it's an impressive achievement that Argonaut was able to nearly emulate a Super Mario 64-style 3D environment on the Sony PlayStation, though it's less impressive that it wasn't able to imitate the game's perspective and control. The creators of SM64 knew that to be able to functionally jump from platform to platform, the default view would have to be directly above and behind the main character, and it is, or can be configured to be, about 95 percent of the time. In Croc however, the player is locked into a behind-and-to-the-side view during about half of the game's crucial moments, making jumps or even general movement far harder than they should be. In the beginning, this is far less of an issue and Croc shows off how much of an enjoyable title it could have been. But soon, moving platforms, dissolving platforms, and other such devices are added to the mix and the fun factor of the game falls off a cliff. Yes, this perspective/control problem makes it that horribly frustrating to play - even the use of Sony's Dual Analog Controller can't save it.  <P>In the end, Croc: Legend of Gobbos is a charmingly-enough-themed platformer that just didn't live up to its potential. It ended up a Christmas holiday must-rent, when it could have been a Christmas holiday must-have. -- Joe Fielder <P><I>--Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Gameplay is turn-based and takes place on a world map that\'s broken down into an octagonal grid, with players controlling a civilization from its inception in 4000 B.C. all the way through A.D. 2020.

This freedom in decision-making, along with a good amount of game options and the fact that the ""world"" is randomly generated each time you begin a game, adds extremely high replay value.', ""While <i>Civilization II</i> has been slightly pared down and doesn't look as good as it does on a computer--the graphics here are muddy, and text can be hard to read--the customized PlayStation control interface works surprisingly well. (Keyboard and mouse controls generally don't translate well to the PlayStation controller, to put it mildly.) --<i>Joe Hon</i>"", '<b>Pros:</b> <ul> <li>Faithful adaptation of one of the best computer strategy games of all time <li>Control interface has been customized for the PlayStation <li>Extremely high replay value </ul> <b>Cons:</b> <ul> <li>Muddy graphics; hard-to-read text </ul>', 'There have been a lot of great moments in the world of gaming, but starting a game of Civilization II has to be one of the best. There you are, cast into the distant past, alone in the wilderness with nothing but a small band of settlers. Before you lies the greatest challenge imaginable: to build an empire that is powerful enough to span the globe, advanced enough to reach the stars, and durable enough to stand the test of time. <P>Just gives you chills, doesn\'t it? No wonder the Civilization series has been among the most popular ever released on the PC, and that its creator, Sid Meier, is widely recognized as one of the best game designers in the world. Now, PlayStation owners have a chance to experience this empire-building phenomenon firsthand, with the newly released Civilization II. <P>A little background is in order. Civilization II is a turn-based strategy game that incorporates a seemingly endless array of options. In playing the game, you\'ll build cities, construct wonders, research new technologies, raise armies, develop an economy, and engage in diplomatic tete-a-tetes with other rulers. The game begins in the prehistoric era (around 3500 BC) and ends in the late 21st century (assuming you survive that long!). The goal is to wipe out all the other empires on Earth - you must contend with the likes of Genghis Khan, Catherine the Great, and Napoleon, among others - or be the first to colonize a planet successfully in far-off Alpha Centauri.  <P>As you might have gathered by now, playing Civilization II is a highly involved intellectual exercise that puts a premium on strategic thinking and long-term planning. It takes patience to learn the rules, although a tutorial mode helps quite a bit. The games themselves can last 30 hours or more. In other words, if you are in search of a quick adrenaline rush, you are advised to run, not walk, away from this game.  <P>However, if you\'re willing to invest the necessary time to learn and play Civilization II, you will be rewarded by some of the most intricate and involving gameplay available on the PlayStation. The level of control you have over your empire - everything from the political orientation to the tax rate to the names of cities, is under your command - lets you build a civilization that reflects your own personality. Be a violent dictator, a benevolent prince, or a noble republican. Forge alliances with other powers and then betray your allies when it suits you. Build a peaceful, economically oriented civilization and then convert your wealth into military might and crush your unsuspecting enemies. The bottom line is that just about whatever you dream up, you can do, and that is what makes Civilization II such a joy to play. <P>Not that this version isn\'t without some shortcomings. Even in its PC form, Civilization II was never much to look at, and things have gotten considerably rougher with this port. As the game progresses, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between units, and it\'s consistently hard to read the fuzzy text on the screen. While the control-pad interface is quite efficient, the lower resolution means that almost all the game\'s menus and information screens have been redesigned for the PlayStation, and many of them seem thrown together. (The world map is particularly horrible.) The sound is also dull by today\'s standards, and the background music gets monotonous as the hours go by. (Fortunately, you can turn it down.) And at ten blocks per saved game, you\'ll be stacking up the memory cards in no time, since you\'ll want to save every few turns. <P>For purists, I should also mention that there are a couple of fairly significant gameplay changes between this and the PC version. The first is that this version appears to use the combat engine from the original Civilization, rather than the more sophisticated engine introduced in the original version of Civilization II. This isn\'t that big of a deal - personally, I always thought the older engine was better - but it is somewhat curious. The other major change is that the PlayStation version doesn\'t include certain automation features (such as ""smart"" settlers that automatically improve your cities), which means you\'ll have to do a little more micromanagement than you might expect if you have had experience with the PC version. Finally, it seems that, level for level, the PlayStation version is somewhat easier than the PC version. (Either that, or I\'m a lot better at this game than I used to be!) <P>In the final analysis, Civilization II is just that - a game of analysis - and as such it\'s a welcome change of pace for the PlayStation. If the graphics were better, it would be a must-buy, but as it is, Civilization II is a solid, if not spectacular, game that strategy fans will not want to miss. --Vince Broady <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Built around an engaging story, <i>Akuji</i> is a bitter struggle against the evils of your heritage. Wrist blades and devastating spells are your only allies in this horrific battle. While the basic key hunt structure of most first- and third-person shooters is also present here, the grimly fascinating story line keeps the player involved. That said, the nightmarish reality of Akuji's voodoo struggle is not for the squeamish. <i>--Allen Stewart</i>"", '<b>Pros:</b> <ul> <li>Beautiful, fluid graphics</li> <li>Compelling story</li> <li>Spooky sound effects and scenery</li> </ul> <b>Cons:</b> <ul> <li>Very creepy plot</li> <li>Little variation of enemies</li> <li>Too dependent on monotonous key hunts</li> </ul>', 'With a modified Gex: Enter the Gecko engine at its core and a loose interpretation of voodoo as its backbone, Crystal Dynamics\' Akuji the Heartless is a grim and gritty ""full scroller"" that dares to defy Spyro the Dragon and the rest of the recent slew of light-hearted 3D platform games for the PlayStation. The story is equal parts Todd McFarlane\'s Spawn and Dante\'s Inferno: You\'re a voodoo-practicing, blade-wielding hero, and you\'ve been slaughtered and had your heart ripped out on your wedding day by your brother. Now you travel through the planes of hell, destroying its caretakers and collecting the souls of your ancestors for the top-hat-wearing voodoo loa, Baron Samedi. If you do, he\'s promised to grant you passage out of the underworld to take revenge on your sibling rival and reunite with your sweetheart.  <P>Visually, Akuji\'s 3D world appears much like a darker-themed version of Gex: Enter the Gecko and carries many impressive little graphical and lighting effects throughout (the chamber of rolling snakeskins comes to mind). Undercutting these niceties, though, is the game\'s camera, which can be moved from side to side around the character using the L1 and R1 buttons, targeted with R2, or else it otherwise eventually shifts into position. The problem is that ""eventually"" takes too long to rely on, causing you to continually shift the camera around, hence turning the perspective into another of the game\'s many puzzles. (I don\'t know about you, but I have simple enough needs when it comes to 3D platform-game cameras: I just want them to stick in a view that\'s aimed in the direction my character is facing.) <P>The music in Akuji is exceptional. It has an excellent undulating soundtrack that obviously loops but also changes its rhythm from time to time and keeps its jungle beat sounding continually fresh. The pace of the music also picks up whenever a fight begins, which works to build tension unless you\'re confronting the most pathetic grunt creature. Both elements work together to set a great mood for the game. The voice work, on the other hand, is only decent. Akuji\'s voice-overs (done by Shaft\'s Richard Roundtree) are occasionally delivered in a tone of near disbelief (when he picks up the Hell Blast spell, he says ""Hell-Blast"" as if asking a voice coach, ""Is this right?"") and are never as dynamic as you\'d expect them to be. Slightly worth noting is the fact that Akuji\'s bride-to-be sounds far too old for him, leading to the thought of her being his mother instead. (If you make that leap, the beginning of the game is very funny. When she starts explaining the basics, you think, ""Aw mom! Leave me alone! I\'m trying to play a game!"")  <P>Besides the game camera though, the rest of this is ancillary to the title\'s gameplay, which is decent and sometimes very fun. It\'s a nice, easy little platform game that\'ll only take you about eight to ten hours to beat in all, making it a good, brief distraction from tougher, time-devouring titles such as Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. It\'s over a little too quickly to recommend Akuji for purchase, but it\'s well worth the money and time it\'d take to rent it. -- Steven Garrett <P><I>--Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

286,NCAA Final Four '99,"['In the class of college basketball games, NCAA Final Four 99 gets a passing grade because it delivers what its peers have failed to: fast-paced gameplay. But don\'t get too excited: 989 Sports\' first foray into college hoops also has suspect AI that\'ll irritate die-hard gamers. <P>Although this title borrows gameplay elements (mainly icon passing and cutting) from its cousin, NBA ShootOut 99, it establishes its own presentation style quite well. Graphically, there isn\'t much to complain about. In addition to detailed stadiums and floors, the game adds nice touches, such as referees and coaches on the sidelines. Perhaps the biggest graphical flaw is the occasional speedup or slowdown in animation when a shot\'s being taken. The commentary by Quinn Buckner may get stale after a while, but it\'s better than nothing. <P>The AI in this game still needs a lot of work. It\'s not really an issue in multiplayer games (where both sides are handicapped equally), but when playing against the computer, be prepared for ""Believe It or Not"" style gameplay. First off, virtually every shot is a fadeaway (outside the paint) or hook (in the paint). Second, players magically slide backwards on defense - sometimes, seemingly teleporting - as they defendagainst a fast break. <P>This game\'s AI difficulty level ranges from incredibly easy to incredibly cheesy. There are some cheap ways to beat the computer, even at the highest difficulty level. For instance, repeated jumping on defense almost always guarantees a steal when a wing tries to dump the ball into the post. At the easiest level, you can win on turbo-button fast breaks and no-brainer threes. At the toughest level, be prepared for your AI opponent - even a horrid team - to make every shot, despite being double- or triple-teamed. This is hardly realistic, and provides virtually no incentive to play solid defense, so games at this difficulty degenerate into who can pull off the most cheesy steals and score the most. <P>989 Sports does fill this game with original new features that raise its value. The most notable (and worthy of praise) is the optional shot meter. With it on, you can see the point where you should release the shooting button to make an accurate shot. This instant feedback adds excitement to the game by making every shot an exercise in reflexes. Plus, if you\'re a new player, it gives you a feel for the timing needed for outside shots and fadeaways. <P>Undoubtedly, you probably want to know how this game stacks up against NCAA March Madness 99. Despite the previously mentioned AI flaws, this title has a distinct edge. First and foremost, this game has more than twice as many teams. These extra teams, mainly from smaller conferences, make it much easier to simulate this year\'s NCAA tournament, as well as serve to appease you if you\'re from  one of the schools slighted by March Madness 99. Second, while the titles are dead even in the graphics department, 989 Sports\' game can play much faster, thanks to an adjustable game speed option. <P>Final Four 99 does lack the extras found in its main competitor - mainly, no women\'s play and no season-end conference tourneys in season mode. It also lacks the exact equivalent of a momentum meter, which gives teams confidence as they make scoring runs. Final Four 99 does have a command to rile up crowds (for home teams) and taunt, but this seems more ornamental than useful.  <P>Final Four 99 has numerous fixes to make before it call itself a great game. Still, for all its flaws, it\'s the most fun-to-play college basketball game on the market so far, if only for its faster speed. It\'s a game that most casual fans would probably be willing to settle for. --Nelson Taruc <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

291,Castlevania 64,"['Cartridge only with minor wear.', ""Konami's long-running Castlevania series is renowned for its chilling atmosphere, fantastic music, and, most importantly, superb 2D gameplay. Now, for the first time in its illustrious 13-year career, the series is making the jump into 3D - a jump that understandably has many fans feeling quite skeptical. Fortunately, the development team at KCE Kobe has done an excellent job of making the transition to 3D, while still staying true to the series' roots. While not quite the overall epic masterpiece that was Symphony of the Night on the PlayStation, N64 Castlevania provides an oddly compelling 3D vampire-hunting experience that fans of the series should definitely not miss. <P>Castlevania lets you take the role of either Reinhardt Schneider, the latest whip-toting member of the Belmont clan (don't ask us why he's got a different last name), or Carrie Fernandez, a young girl with magical powers and a grudge. Both characters have their own separate (though similar) storylines, complete with entirely different endings and a couple of stages that are exclusive to each other's quests. Interestingly enough (to hard-core Castlevania fans, anyway), Carrie is a descendant of Sypha Belnades, the 15th century mage from Castlevania III. Unfortunately, Konami didn't bother to keep Carrie's and Sypha's last names consistent in the translation, thus ruining an otherwise interesting plot point of the game. <P>Unlike Symphony of the Night, with its RPG-like elements and free-roaming gameplay, N64 Castlevania plays more like the older games in the series (aside from the obvious fact that the gameworld is now 3D). The game progression is more linear, and each character has only two weapons they can use (a main weapon that can be powered up twice and a subweapon). The trademark special weapons are back (knife, ax, holy water, and cross), but as far as items go, there are only a few that you can collect during play, most of which are of the healing type. <P>While the game does feature a real-time clock function (similar to Zelda), it doesn't factor in to gameplay nearly as much as you'd hope. Only a couple of puzzles rely on the time of day, and they're hardly what you'd call inspired. There are a few other thought-provoking puzzles in the game (similar in style to the ones found in Resident Evil), but otherwise most of the emphasis has been placed on well-timed jumps and old-school platform-style gameplay. Some of these jumps can be rather frustrating if you're not careful with the controls, but it's nothing any old-school NES Castlevania fan won't be able to handle. <P>Each of the game's 12-plus stages is huge. A couple of the more confusing ones would've benefited from an in-game map (like the Forest of Silence and the Tunnel), but on the whole, the level designs are very nicely done. The graphics are nice and varied, with good use of textures and very little fogging (which seems to be used for atmosphere more than anything else). The lighting is real impressive, too. If there's one thing worth complaining about, it's the camera. All things considered, it's not that bad, but it does seem to get out of whack at the worst possible moments - especially in high-risk areas or during fast-paced battles. The game does offer three different camera styles, but the problems stem more from collision detection than the actual viewpoints. <P>Despite these minor gripes, Castlevania definitely excels. The developers have done a fantastic job of capturing the atmosphere and spirit of the series, while providing a well-balanced, challenging gameplay experience that's filled with pretty visuals, awesome (though limited) music, plenty of secrets, and some incredible bosses (just wait until you see Death... whew!). Let's just hope this doesn't mark the end of the 2D era of Castlevania games. -- John Morris <P><I>--Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

294,Jet Moto 2,"['THIS IS FOR THE SONY PLAYSTATION CD-ROM VIDEO GAME VERSION. \n\nNow we have the sequel, and it\'s not at all nice, either. The immediate attraction to Jet Moto 2 lies in the variety of tracks offered. The original stuck mostly to a safe compilation of sand, sea, and snow-based courses, which is fine, but didn\'t give much room for creativity. And while its follow-up does feature its fair share of deserts and mountainsides, it does so with extreme and creative touches: A remote desert location leads up the side of a lava-spewing volcano, and the lava really does hurt. The level Aftershock takes you from a wreckage-filled ocean into the remains of a toxic, quake-ridden Los Angeles. And Rollercide leads you along the tracks of a demented carnival\'s roller coaster. By far the most insane of this berserk cocktail is Nebulous, the demonically difficult finale that guides you through the heavens and into well, you\'ll see. These bizarre levels take the Jet Moto series yet another step away from the traditional racer and are rescued from the threat of ""gimmickiness"" by the perverse and detailed humor that SingleTrac so deftly displayed in its awesome Twisted Metal series.', ""<i>Jet Moto 2</i> suffers from many of the same problems as the first <i>Jet Moto</i>. While it is basically just a racing game with an aerial twist, overall playability suffers due to the difficulty of turning at high speeds. As before, different racers ride on aerial jet bikes. Each character has a corporate sponsorship and a different set of advantages and disadvantages. However, no character is easy to master. In addition, you must come in first in each race to advance beyond the first three races. This is plenty difficult, and the muddy graphics don't help much. While the courses add interesting elements such as water, lava, and other obstacles, the proper pathway is often unclear due to poor graphics or badly designed levels."", ""Overall, this is a fun racing game for the hard-core racing fan, but those who really want to fly are better off with something that offers clearer graphics. Another problem stems from the fact that if you knock another racer off his or her cycle, but the cycle goes forward, then the recent victim of your assault starts where his or her cycle stops.

295,Penny Racers - Nintendo 64,"['Based on the toy line of miniaturized cars, <i>Penny Racers</i> is cutesy kart racing with a twist. Rather than selecting a car with predetermined characteristics as in most games of this genre, you customize a generic Racer with almost 100 parts in eight different categories. Starting off with the worst possible parts, you must win races to get better parts, which you ""relieve"" the losers of; this can lead to some serious cutthroat action when it comes to multiplayer games. High replay value is further upped by the game\'s ""New Track"" option, which allows you to create your very own tracks.', 'The downside to all these custom options is the fact that a <a href=""/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00001WRIM/${0}"">Memory Pack</a> is more of a necessity than a ""supported"" accessory. Without one, you can\'t save any Racer or track data, and it would be a real shame to lose that Japanese noodle shop truck with the off-road tires and roof-mounted cannon when you turn off your Nintendo. <i>--Joe Hon</i>', '<b>Pros:</b> <ul> <li>Wide variety of customization options for your Racer</li> <li>Ability to create your own tracks</li> <li>High replay value and excellent multiplayer action</li> </ul> <b>Cons:</b> <ul> <li>Memory Pack more of a requirement than an option</li> <li>3- and 4-player modes available only on custom-made tracks</li> <li>Cartoony theme may turn off veteran gamers</li> </ul>', 'Import-savvy fans will recognize Penny Racers as the domesticated version of Takara\'s Choro-Q 64. Basically the N64 addition to the Choro-Q series, which originally made famous on the PlayStation, revolves around a slew of wacky superdeformed cars and trucks that, naturally enough, are all trying to get to the finish line first. Duh! Penny Racers attempts to improve on this ""concept"" by adding four-player racing to the mix. Does it match up, or surpass, the previous installments of its 32-bit counterpart? Hardly. <P>Sure, the cars and tracks found on the PlayStation were cartoony enough, but the graphical complexity found in Penny Racers sinks to a new low. Simpler than even Mario 64 or Pilotwings, Penny Racers makes Mario Kart 64 look like Sonic Adventure. Bland, color-by-number track design offers little in the way of detail, and the complete lack of light sourcing and the generally slow pace of the game give Penny Racers an anemic visual impression at best. Perhaps the most aggravating thing is that the cars (which are simple, low-poly-count designs) still have the blocky, non-anti-aliased look of the PlayStation version. Surely with all the power of the N64, the cars could have been made to look a touch better? <P>Graphic faux pas aside, the gameplay has also taken a turn for the worse. Driving in Penny Racers feels like you\'re always riding on a dusty highway, and while that may be fine for some of you cowboys out there, the utter lack of grippage in this game wears extremely thin on the patience. Sure you can do barrel rolls(?), but this technique adds little to the game. Presumably this tactic was added to give you an option, while trying to avoid the Wipeout-esque weaponry available to all of the racers. Whoa, is that a land mine? Hey, barrel-roll out of the way! <P>Once you adjust to the slide-a-thon, you might actually wind up in first place, at which point you\'ll be able to start upgrading your car, which is really the only saving point of this game. The Choro-Q series has always been about customization, and it\'s no different here. Tons of different options await the best drivers: dozens of car types and styles, multitudes of accessories and colors, etc. Having the patience to access all of these prizes is another matter. <P>Musically, most people will want to turn down the chirpy, 16-bit-sounding music before it raises their blood pressure too high. A tweaky, bleepy, honking apparition of a soundtrack ""graces"" Penny Racers, which makes one glad for the volume control in the game. The best advice is to turn it all the way down. <P>If you have four people in your household impervious to the many visual and musical assaults found in the game, there is a four-player mode.

296,Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back,"['Black Label Edition game disc only.', ""Let me go on record and say that I was never a fan of the original Crash Bandicoot. Even though Crash was disarmingly cute and fuzzy, and even though the game's graphics were just about as good as they got in those days, the frustrating design of the game made playing it such a painful experience that I still have flashbacks when I see small marsupials on the Discovery Channel. But just one short year after his debut, Crash is back in a sequel that is so far superior to the original that I'm willing to forget the mistakes of the past. <P>The new storyline is simple: A very gullible Crash is corralled into collecting crystals for the evil Dr. Cortex and gems for the terrible N. Brio. There are 25 levels in all; each level contains an easy-to-find crystal and hard-to-earn gems. Instead of being forced to approach the game in a strictly linear fashion, you progress through a series of five warp rooms. Each warp room contains five levels, which you are free to tackle in any order. After you have found the crystals in each level, you can progress to the next warp room. This system of warp rooms is a great innovation; it's clear how to progress in the game, and yet you have the option of moving to a different level if you're hopelessly frustrated with one area. Best of all, you can save your game in the warp room at any time (a big improvement over the original game's horrific save system). <P>A lot of variety is packed inside this game. You'll navigate through simple run-and-jump areas, try to outrun a very mad polar bear, work your way through sewer systems, and even fly around with a jet pack. Within each level, the basic gameplay is similar to the original Crash: Running, jumping, and spinning are still the order of the day. Even though most levels are set in a semi-3D environment, Crash Bandicoot 2 is a platform game, plain and simple. The graphics are in a league of their own among PlayStation games, and the music couldn't be better. Unlike the original, Crash 2 is rarely frustrating enough to make you want to throw your controller at the TV. In fact, some expert gamers might find Crash to be a little on the easy side. <P>There are only two real problems with Crash Bandicoot 2. First, the semi-3D setup is sometimes hard to navigate, and you'll find yourself missing jumps because you're unable to judge distances properly. Secondly, the game is just plain cheap at times; in some areas you must sacrifice many lives until you memorize a level's layout. <P>In any event, these problems are balanced out by the game's excellent gameplay and intelligent design. Crash Bandicoot 2 is a topnotch platform game. If you're a fan of the genre, you owe it to yourself to check this title out. -- John Broady <P><I>--Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Each course makes for good racing, thanks to a full complement of cool jumps and sharp turns. The courses vary enough that players need to acquire a different strategy for each.

There are the typical left/right, speed up/slow down controls, along with requisite ""turbo"" boosts. A neat feature is the magnetic ""grapple"" that allows for tight, high-speed turns on corners with magnetic ""grapple posts."" This feature is utilized quite cleverly on some levels, and is the basis of others (in which players run the course in both directions and must make incredibly tight turns). Aside from the grapple, the controls leave something to be desired. It\'s a struggle to turn fast and accurately, and crashing is frequent (resulting in not-so-fantastic crash replays).', 'Keeping all of the above in mind, Jet Moto is incredibly difficult. Given the marginal play control and general difficulty of the game, things can get pretty frustrating very quickly. To get past each batch of three courses players must finish first on all three (not an average, but first in each race). While this sounds easy, it\'s not. The 20 selectable riders are divided into corporate-sponsored teams, and each possesses his own strengths. That is to say, there is no ""dream team"" that lets players breeze through the game. No matter which rider is selected, players are in for a challenge - mastering each course can take hours. The difficulty level can be notched down, but this limits progress through the game. If it weren\'t for the GameShark, I doubt I would have been able to access the later levels (which include the awesome snow courses).', ""Jet Moto has some really cool features, but the game takes far too long to master.

302,WWF In Your House,"['ps1', ""Ten top name pro wrestlers butt heads in Acclaim's In Your House. These include the British Bulldog, Goldust, Bret Hart, Undertaker, and Ultimate Warrior. Each has his own particular ring setting, from the Undertaker's gloomy surroundings (complete with a spider web floor mat and skull turnbuckles), to Ultimate Warrior's outdoor Western locale. <P>The fighting action is solid. In addition to the standard backbreakers, suplexes, and clotheslines, each wrestler has his own special moves and attacks - nothing you're likely to find on Saturday morning TV. These brawlers mutate into animals, pull weapons out of thin air, and throw lightning. Wrestlers can utilize multiple-hit combos fueled by WWF power-up icons that randomly appear in the ring. In short, there is plenty of superhuman fighting action, including the familiar send-the-opponent-to-the-ceiling uppercut. Unfortunately, much of the play seems a little too familiar - the debt owed to Mortal Kombat and Killer Instinct is an obvious one. The characters are all digitized sprites of the actual wrestlers. They move, fall, and jump exactly like the MK combatants. <P>While the game plays well enough, it lacks variety. Available play modes consist of a WWF Season, an Intercontinental Championship, and a WWF Championship, and vary only in number of opponents. Players will find no steel cage matches, no battle royales, no tag team option, and no chairs to smash over the opponent's head.

308,Blast Radius,"['Factory Sealed', ""What do you get when you have the Colony Wars series, take out the backbreaking mission requirements, and throw in a lot more arcade-style blasting action? You get Blast Radius, that's what. Assuming the role of Kayne, you are the last remaining member of the recently eliminated Wolf Squadron. Conveniently for your employment situation, the Vorn, a gentle race currently under siege by the horrible advances of the nasty Kotan-Kai, implore you to aid them in their time of need. In return, you get to fly the Vorn's most advanced craft and weapons (why they couldn't do it themselves is beyond me) as you hurl yourself into battle against these worthy opponents. <P>In Blast Radius, you can choose from nine different assault vehicles of varying appearances, abilities, and weapons. Your streamlined HUD displays the various attributes your craft is currently equipped with: primary weapon, radar, ammo, turbo, lock-on laser info, and fuel. There is a lock-on cursor and targeting arrow that point you to your nearest enemy. Other optional weapons include torpedoes, rockets, seeker missiles, locking lasers, and fusion nukes for eye-shattering explosions and high-powered attacks.  <P>It will be apparent to veterans of the Colony Wars series that Blast Radius seems just like Colony Wars. While that's not a bad thing - and the action definitely seems to be the drawing point here - it just seems more like an expansion pack than anything else. You fly through the semi-uncharted reaches of space while attempting to down as many hostile craft as you can. If you haven't already gotten Colony Wars: Vengeance yet, and you are thinking about buying it, Blast Radius is an alternative you might want to consider because of its easier learning curve. That's not to say that the enemy ships are a cakewalk; it's just that the mission requirements rely less on nearly impossible tasks than on straightforward dogfights.  <P>The game uses the Colony Wars engine, ensuring that the action moves at a smooth pace and that the control is dead-on. The ship and battle-cruiser models seem to be more brightly colored than the ships in Colony Wars, making it easier for you to spot your enemy far off on the horizon. Weapons and weapon effects are predictably spectacular, being trademark psygnosis. The only downside is the ship design, which looks mostly ham-fisted and awkward. You'd imagine the most advanced ships of the future (or distant galaxies) to be the sexiest, most streamlined fighters you've ever seen. Instead - and this goes for Colony Wars' ships too - the designs are clumsy and often seem forced. It's not too exciting to fly something that looks like a big horseshoe or stapler while fighting the scourge of the universe. In its defense, the sound is super, with ship buzzing all around you, and lasers and explosions causing considerable neighbor-waking noise. Adding to the carnage is the link-cable option. If you have a friend with his own PlayStation, his own copy of Blast Radius, and a link cable, you can hook up for cooperative play or face off against each other in deathmatch mode. This should provide many high-speed intergalactic battles, should you meet the requirements. <P>So, while Blast Radius tends to feel a bit like a throwaway or, rather, it feels as though the company is simple cashing-in on its own success, it is nevertheless a worthwhile way to kill some time. If you liked Colony Wars and are looking for more of the same high-quality space-shooting action, Blast Radius is going to be your best option. Whether it's worth a purchase largely depends on how much you really need it. A rental might be your first move. --James Mielke <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

309,Mario Party,"['Mario Party [Japanese Import] for Nintendo 64', 'Mario Party is the first of several Mario games planned for this year that are being created by developers outside of Nintendo. In this case, the developer is Hudson, a company best known for the Bomberman series, while the others are HAL Systems, the creator of the Kirby line (which is handling the Mario fighting game, Smash Brothers), and Hot Shots Golf maker Camelot (which is doing Mario Golf). Each of the games\' focus plays to what the developers know best, in this case, Hudson\'s knowledge of good multiplayer game modes gleaned from producing countless incarnations of Bomberman, the seminal party-game series.  <P>How do they do that? By setting up Mario Party as a video game take on a traditional board game. One to four players compete against each other (and computer opponents if there are fewer than four humans present) for coins, stars, and bonus points. Instead of going the route of Monopoly\'s little dog and top hat assortment, Mario Party offers a handful of Mario characters for use as ""game pieces"" such as Mario, Yoshi, Wario, Peach, Donkey Kong, and Luigi. Each of the title\'s boards is based on the series as well (Donkey Kong has a jungle stage, Yoshi an island, and so on), and each differs in prominent ways. Once the characters and board are chosen, you vie for the order you\'ll proceed through the game by stopping a rotating number block, which reappears at the beginning of each turn to decide how many spaces you\'ll move. Plain spaces provide a number of coins, while specially marked spaces will draw you into bonus minigames (explained fully later) or introduce you to friendly or unfriendly nonplayer characters such as Toad, Shy Guy, and Boo. The one you least want to bump into is of course Bowser, who will either steal coins from you outright or engage you in forced minigames where you don\'t gain any coins if you win, and you lose coins if you lose. The main goal is to have the largest total number of stars at the end of a game, which can be bought along the way from Toad or by paying off a Boo to steal one from one of your opponents (this costs more than twice the regular 20-coin amount but is much more fun).  <P>The minigames are the Mario Party features that most take advantage of the title not being set on a flat plate of cardboard. You enter at the end of each round or by landing on marked spaces on the board. The games come in various shapes and sizes and in configurations of every player against the others, two vs. two, or three against one. Of the 50 in all, the most noteworthy examples are probably the Bobsled Run (which is reminiscent of the snow race in Super Mario 64, but with two characters sharing a sled), Face Lift (you try to drag around a mushed face a la Super Mario 64\'s intro), Mario Bandstand (a distant cousin of Parappa the Rapper), Lava Boardin\' (you race down a collapsing platform and jump over obstacles), and Cash Bash (one player is dressed up as Bowser, and the others hit him with hammers and steal his coins). Some are skill based, while many require button mashing or joystick twirling. The winner or winners gain coins, while the losers pay out or just leave with what they came into the game with - nothing more, nothing less. <P>Playing with a group of friends makes this game shine. There are enough random elements at work that enable huge upsets to happen about once every other round (which continues straight up to the end when bonus stars are given out that can nudge second- or third-place players to the forefront), and going after the lead player or teaming up against the computer is superfun - especially when you\'re trying to garner stars for the collective total (get enough and... things happen). On the negative side, some of the minigames aren\'t very fun to play in the multiplayer mode because of control or perspective problems, or because they\'re just plain boring - but that\'s to be expected with the sheer number of games. Meanwhile, the games that are enjoyable to play in multiplayer are nowhere near as good in the single-player mode. Really, it\'s that multiplayer competitive spark of screaming at and/or cheering for your friends that injects life into these often-simple little games, and without it, they\'re just simple little games. The single-player mode seems thrown in the way multiplayer modes seem thrown in most other games. Mario Party is intended to be played with a group of friends, and for those people who can really take advantage of that, this game is a must-buy. The less-social gamer might want to rent. --Joe Fielder <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Lead by the messianic Kron, Mertens and the rest of the Navy plunge headlong into the heart of League territory, hoping to restore the Navy to its prior greatness... or die trying. But is the charismatic Navy leader all that he seems?"", 'In response to player feedback, Psygnosis packed a number of improvements into Colony Wars: Vengeance. While the number of selectable ships has dropped from seven to five, a brand-new upgrade system now enables you to customize each craft to your liking. Devastating ""sentinel"" superweapons in addition to new air-to-ground combat infuse the game with some sorely needed variety. The game\'s collision detection and physics also have been improved thanks to a powerful new game engine. The one thing that hasn\'t changed, however, is the game\'s nearly impossible level of difficulty; Colony Wars: Vengeance is guaranteed to provide a formidable challenge for even the most battle-tested PlayStation pilots.', 'As in the original, failing a mission does not lead to instantaneous death, as it does in most games of Colony Wars\' ilk; rather, a branching mission tree spins the story in new directions, ultimately leading to one of six unique endings. In all, Colony Wars: Vengeance spans over 40 missions, arranged into 19 different ""acts."" Unlocking the game\'s most desirable ending automatically rewards the player with the entire mission tree, which allows you to dish out some serious payback by replaying any of the previous missions - with the ship of your choice - infusing Colony Wars: Vengeance with an uncommon amount of replay value.', 'The real question, however, is whether or not the average player will possess the patience and persistence to make it that far. Severely unbalanced missions (the fifth Sentinel is a breeze compared with the second) and an almost insane level of difficulty undoubtedly will have many gamers, if not most, flinging their controllers in disgust long before the game\'s halfway point, which really is a pity; a more gradual ""ramping"" of the level of difficulty would have made the game more enjoyable and accessible to casual gamers while allowing them to experience more of the game\'s visual fireworks and story elements. By the time I reached the game\'s supposedly climactic plot twist, I was simply too beaten down to care much about Mertens anymore.', ""As for Colony Wars: Vengeance's cosmetic improvements, I gladly would have traded all of them for a two-player cooperative or head-to-head mode. A cooperative mode, in particular, would have killed two birds with one stone by making the game easier while allowing a friend to join in the fun."", ""Despite its flaws, the game's head-turning graphics, diversity, and uncommonly developed story propel Colony Wars: Vengeance light years ahead of the average space shooter.

Not only is the animation incredibly smooth, but every polygonal building and ship is finely detailed. The enemies are also quite varied - in fact, the final boss, Andross, even qualifies as menacingly scary (there's something terrifying about a huge ape that literally chews you up and spits you out).

Your wingmen Slippy (a frog), Falco (a falcon), and Peppy (a rabbit) accompany you on missions and offer advice on each level - they can also help you out in a jam, but you should expect to come to their rescue more often than not. The interaction between the four main characters makes for some of the most entertaining voice-overs yet heard in a video game and proves that the N64 doesn\'t need a CD drive to offer a vast array of speech. In fact, a third of the game\'s cartridge is used for the memorable chatter, which includes such lines as ""Let\'s show those monkey people who\'s boss,"" and ""Oh noooo!"" which is shrieked by Slippy, who\'s gender is, sadly, never revealed.', 'Star Fox 64 is the kind of game you will spend many sleepless nights with - even after you finish.

313,Monkey Hero,"['With an eye for excitement and a nose for nonsense Monkey Hero is one funky monkey. Join monkey as he explores massive dungeons and battles legions of baddies in a crusade to restore peace among the three worlds.', 'Sometimes even the best intentions go to waste, and Monkey Hero is an unfortunate testament to this. Intended as a Japanese-style action/RPG in the old-school vein of Zelda, Monkey Hero is just about as ill conceived and poorly done as one can imagine, and it\'s only made more lamentable by its purported homage to the classics. <P>Loosely based on Chinese lore, Monkey Hero follows the mythic exploits of one ""Monkey"" and his quest to return balance to the dream world, waking world and nightmare world and defeat the uniform-clad Nightmare King. To do so, Monkey must travel across the world to retrieve the eight chapters of a magic story book. Monkey Hero\'s gameplay is, unfortunately, below the generic level of the game\'s story. Inspired by the Zelda series and games of its ilk, Monkey Hero takes a broad stab at the action/adventure genre and provides Monkey with all the requisite tools, heart-container-equivalents and the like to complete his quest. Complete with a bird\'s-eye view of the ""action,"" Monkey hero is Blam!\'s attempt to implement every classically tested variable of the action/adventure formula. <P>However, that formula has yet to produce so painful a game. Monkey Hero\'s gameplay is often bad, occasionally mediocre, and thoroughly boring throughout. To start, one could make a case that the game\'s world is too big. This is a problem only because the game makes very little attempt to provide you with direction; often you are left to wander around, either looking for the next item or the next obstacle to remove. There has to be a better way than this to move away from the traditional linearity of the action/adventure genre. There\'s nothing like getting a new item and looking for one place to use it, only to find five, most of which are dead ends. Monkey Hero is a fairly long game, and it\'s full of these design inadequacies. Should you manage to progress, you\'ll find the game\'s dungeons to be lacking. Between the bland layout and the sparse, uninventive use of puzzles, Monkey Hero\'s dungeons are more exercises in tedium than actual gameplay. Some of the bosses are worthwhile, but they are short-lived, and seem like token reasons to use the game\'s myriad items instead of actual challenges. Additionally, control and collision issues seem to plague the game, adding additional frustration to the poor design. <P>Alas, Monkey Hero\'s problems don\'t end there. Aesthetically, the game is a mess: It looks like a shareware throwback to the first generation of PlayStation games. The game\'s tile-heavy graphics are reminiscent of Interplay\'s abysmal Loaded, unfortunately borrowing that game\'s lighting extremes, as well. Areas are often inexplicably dark, but often have near-invisible enemies lurking in them, generally resulting in cheap hits. The game\'s terrain is flat and uninteresting, and all the art is decidedly blocky. Monkey Hero anachronistically relies on sprites for enemies, and they\'re not pretty, either. In addition to being small and of basic geometry, their animation is unforgivably poor, rarely more than a few frames. Despite the game\'s extremely basic 3D graphics, the frame rate is decidedly poor on the whole, slowing down at the most inopportune and inexplicable times. <P>Coupled with the poor animation is an extremely poor use of sound. When you use the hammer item, there\'s no earth-shaking thud to accompany the animation. Additionally, most of the game\'s music is repetitive and used in far too many instances, not to mention that it doesn\'t really carry the game\'s professed Asian overtones. <P>However it happened, Blam!\'s pure intentions went chaotically awry, resulting in one of the worst PlayStation games in recent memory. Blam! knows the classics - here\'s hoping they can mimic them a lot better next time. --Peter Bartholow <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

314,Snowboard Kids 2,"['Cartridge only with minor wear.', 'The kids are back, and Snow Town\'s under siege by some bratty little punk named Damien. Arriving surprisingly fast after the debut of the original game, Snowboard Kids 2 brings back the same style of simple snowboarding action with a whole host of options to make your gaming experience as complete as can be. For anyone new to Atlus\' funky little racing game, Snowboard Kids 2 offers a touch of Cool Boarders, with a dash of Wipeout thrown in for good measure. You pick one character out of a posse of ten-year-olds. The characters range from the ""naughty"" Slash Kamei, to the mega-genius Wendy Lane. The characters have different attributes, which give them distinct advantages, depending on which course you\'re playing: speed, shooting, or tricks. Adding to the flexibility of the game are the different boards, which cover speed, balance, and tricks.', ""Gameplay consists of the usual zooming-down-the-course action, with a few twists to keep the action fresh. Among the variety of slopes and courses available (Sunny Mountain, Turtle Island, Jingle Town, Wendy's House, Linda's Castle, and Crazy Jungle) are numerous obstacles and varying course elements, like waterfalls and steep cliff drops. If those weren't enough, there are also offensive and defensive weapons available (hence, the Wipeout comparison). There are a bunch of great weapons that can quickly change the outcome of the game. The slap stick, for example, will smack your opponents to the ground and take some of their money while it's at it. The parachute attack will lift your targets high into the air and drop them slowly to the ground, giving you plenty of time to overtake them. Other weapons, like the snowman, whirlwind, freeze shot, and super ghost can also cause much consternation for your opponents. Of course, to counter players who may be drawing a bead on you are items like the speed fan, rocket booster, rock, and rat face. Each of these has different effects that can save your place in the race, if need be. While the steering and feel of the game could be a little smoother, once you get used to the semi-wooden controls, things go much easier."", ""After you select story or action mode, you will eventually run into a couple of boss encounters that will test just how much you've learned in the preceding races. You will run into a snowman-robot stage and a dinosaur stage that will test just how good your snowboarding skills are. During each race, you'll head into Snow Town where you can do a little shopping and board customizing. As you earn more money, the quality of board you can buy will improve as well. You can also go into the paint shop and select a new paint job for your snowboard. Other places you can go include Wendy's Internet cafe, where you'll get secret information on courses and other factors in the game. You can also change your character at the school, save at the phone booth, and play a number of different games at the penguin house, clock tower, and Snowboard Times office. Simply put, there's plenty to do in Snowboard Kids 2, and it'll take you a while to unlock all the game's secrets."", ""While it plays a little stiffly, the game still looks nice, with colorful graphics, very little polygon draw-in, and upbeat musical tracks. Peppered with lots of cute little cutscenes, Snowboard Kids 2 offers plenty of replay value and is one of the best racing games out there for a younger audience. Yes, a younger audience. Aimed squarely at the young 'uns, Snowboard Kids 2 is probably one of the best games you could get for a younger gamer. Older vets might find the game tedious, although it would take a real cynic to deny the effort involved in making this game. With the four-player mode offering decent multiplayer options, albeit at a much slower framerate, SK2 might be the best party-racing alternative to Mario Kart 64. Much less contrived than Diddy Kong Racing, Snowboard Kids 2 comes highly recommended for the younger crowd. Experienced gamers might want to rent it before spilling the greenbacks for this cute game. --James Mielke <br />--<i>Copyright 1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

315,WCW Nitro,"['Step into the ring as one of your favorite WCW or NWO superstars! You can choose to battle it out in tag team action or take on the oppostion by yourself. Many of your favorites are here featuring the likes of Hollywood Hogan Lex Luger and many more. Each wrestler has many devastating moves to choose from including unique special moves for each wrestler.', ""Until now, all the WCW-licensed games on the N64 have been based on a Japanese engine used by Asmik in a couple of overseas wrestling games. These games have been tolerable from a gameplay standpoint, but none of them ever really captured the look or feel of actual WCW wrestling. Meanwhile, PlayStation owners have been getting WCW games that look a bit more like the real thing, but the gameplay has been atrociously bad. Now, N64 owners can experience the weak gameplay of the PlayStation WCW games mixed with a bit of the real look and feel of the PlayStation games, though the inadequate storage space of the N64 cartridge keeps some of the atmosphere out of the game. <P>This is essentially a slightly updated version of the WCW Nitro that appeared on the PlayStation. The gameplay remains the same, but the roster has been updated, and wrestlers like Bill Goldberg have been added to the lineup. Gone from the original are the short taunt videos, which, by the way, were the best thing about the PlayStation version of the game. Also gone from the original are the poorly pixelated character graphics. Here, the wrestler models are very sharp, though the skin textures look quite bad. The crowd also looks really, really terrible. The game moves a lot quicker than the PlayStation version, but this gives the game a really strange look - it seems as though the motion-captured animation is simply running too fast. <P>For those unfamiliar with the original version of the game, Nitro eschews the tie-up system of gameplay used by previous WCW games, as well as WWF Warzone, for a different, move-based style. Instead of tying up and pounding buttons to pull off moves, you execute the moves via a series of button presses. When this game came out for the PlayStation, it was nice to see someone trying something new in wrestling games, even if it wasn't too spectacular. But now that THQ has milked this style of gameplay for three games, it's way past its prime. <P>Gameplay modes include the standard championship, which pits you against ten different opponents, one at a time. Win and you're the champion. Lose and you'll get to continue. There's also a tag-team mode and a battle royal, which forces you to toss your opponents over the top rope to eliminate them. <P>WCW Nitro is just a rehash of the PlayStation version, only it's about a year too late. It may have worked as a simultaneous release, but now the game is just plain bad. Even roster updates can't save it from its horrible gameplay and shoddy appearance. Let's hope EA can put out a decent WCW-licensed wrestling game when it takes over the license later this year. --Jeff Gerstmann <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

319,Destruction Derby 2,"[""Destruction Derby is one heck of a confused game. It's probably the only racing game that awards points for smashing into the opposition, even though the more your car makes contact with others, the more likely it is to blow up, thus ending the game. Perhaps because of this irony Destruction Derby, now in its second installment, continues to be one of the Playstation's most exciting racing titles. <P>The basics of Destruction Derby 2 are almost identical to the original. You will still find three modes of play (Wreckin' Racing, Stock Car Racing, and Destruction Derby), three cars to choose from, and a host of different tracks (seven raceways, four Destruction Derby enclosed arenas). What's new in DD2 is the size and speed of the courses. The winding, narrow, claustrophobic roadways of the first Destruction Derby have been replaced with huge, wide superspeedways worthy of games like NASCAR Racing and The Need for Speed. Each track offers its own set of characteristics and physics, with whipping turns, monstrous jumps, and high banks. All are infinitely superior to the tight, slow courses of the original. <P>But don't think for a minute that the game is easy just because the tracks are more conducive to high-speed racing. The sense of speed in DD2 is terrific, though not quite the 250 mph the speedometer claims. Regardless of which car you select, the asphalt in DD2 seems to be covered with glare ice - which means your car will be slippin' and slidin' from the get-go, rocketing the unwary straight to the back of the field. But keeping your car on the track is only half the battle. <P>This wouldn't be Destruction Derby without spectacular vehicular calamities galore - accidents that by far outclass those found in the first version of this game. Cars flip, roll, smoke, and splinter into metallic shards, leaving dangerous bits of shrapnel that in turn lead to some of the best multicar wrecks in gaming. Pit stops have been added for damage repair. Like the original, DD2 boasts some fabulous, photorealistic graphics for a spectacular view (though you'd be a fool to take your eyes off the road!). On the downside, the number of camera views has been reduced to two: in-car and low chase. A high chase view is sadly missing. <P>All things considered, Destruction Derby 2 would be more fun if it were a bit easier to play. Even so, it blows the doors off the original. --Jeff Kitts <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

320,Knockout Kings,"[""Pulse-pounding excitement in the first great boxing game for PlayStation. And only the experts at EA Sports could bring it to you! Knockout Kings features 38 of history's greatest fighters including Sugar Ray Leonard Evander Holyfield even the Greatest Muhammed Ali! How would Ali fare against Evander? Find out! With refereeing by Mills Lane there'll be no ear-biting either! It's just like a real boxing match --except no pay-per-view charges!"", 'Knockout Kings is not only the first boxing game released here in the States for the PlayStation, but is also the most accurate representation of the sport of boxing in a video game to date, though it still has plenty of room for improvement. One area that doesn\'t need any improvement is its authenticity. The game has 38 boxers from the light, middle, and heavyweight divisions from the past and present including Evander Holyfield, Ike Quartey, Lennox Lewis, Michael Moore, Shane Mosley, Oscar De La Hoya, ""Sugar"" Ray Leonard, and Muhammad Ali. For even further authenticity the designers have included real-life venues to fight at like Caesar\'s Palace and Madison Square Garden. <P>You can select from three modes of play. Exhibition allows you to pick your favorite fighters and go at it. Slugfest, which is an arcade-style mode, allows you to pick any two fighters from any weight division and slug it out in a match with exaggerated knockdowns and punches. The career mode lets you create your own boxer from scratch and try to take him from the bottom of the ranks to the top for a shot at the title. In this mode you have 30 generic fighters that you must face. Before each fight you can select what type of training you would like to do. You can select between working the heavy bag, which improves your power, or hitting the speed bag, which helps your speed. Unfortunately, this is merely something to watch for a minute.  <P>Visually, Knockout Kings is simple but effective. The fighters are made up of 3D polygons, but they don\'t look like the typical boxy polygonal characters we see in most games. Instead, the fighters have smooth, realistic-looking bodies, with shoulder and elbow joints that work accurately. The animations of the punches, knockdowns, taunts, and general ring movement also look great. Also, most of the fighters look like their real-life counterparts, not only in facial features but also in body size and motion. The only negative aspect of the graphics is the crowd, which is basically just a still picture. Although the sound of a roaring audience almost makes that still image come to life.  <P>All of the sound effects are fairly accurate. The punches, referee, and fighters\' grunts are all pretty good. But what makes Knockout Kings sound so real are the real voices of Al Albert and Sean O\'Grady of Tuesday Night Fights fame, who provide commentary during the matches, though their vocabulary is unfortunately a bit on the limited side, as they pretty much just stick to saying ""nice (insert name of punch here)"" again and again. Knockout Kings also has the voice talents of ring announcer Jimmy Lennon Jr. and referee Mills Lane as a nice touch for big fights. When you\'re climbing the ranks you have generic refs and ring announcers that work the matches. <P>On the control side of things the game feels a bit sticky because you have to get used to the amount of time that it takes for the animations of different punches. But once you get the hang of how the fighters move around the ring, it\'s not a problem. However, the game only has three control configurations. And the simulation control setup isn\'t what I would consider an ideal setup. The D-pad handles ring movement, you have a left jab button, right cross button, body blow button, and an uppercut button. You can pull off little preset combos, power hooks, and low blows by holding a shoulder button while pressing another button. You can even head-butt your opponent (no, there\'s no ear biting). When defending, you can block high and low, bob and weave, duck, clinch, and shove your opponent away. All of these moves are executed by hitting various button and D-pad combinations. While the preset button configurations get the job done, it would have been better if you could assign specific punches to the button of your choice. The AI of the computer boxers is fairly decent. As in real life, there are two main types: boxers and punchers. Toward the top of the ranks the opposition gets a little tougher, since each opponent seems to be able to hurt you with just about any punch and is nearly impervious to damage. <P>Overall, Knockout Kings is the best representation of the sport of boxing in a game so far. Although it is missing some of the little nuances of real boxing.  It\'s easier for a die-hard boxing fanatic to see all of the little things it could have done a touch better; like parrying, working the angles, and punching power balance. The casual boxing fan probably won\'t notice and will think that it\'s the best boxing game of all time. Which is true, though it\'s still missing a few things that keep it from being the perfect boxing sim. Any boxing fan will love Knockout Kings, and being one myself, I just hope that Electronic Arts continues the series and keeps making it better. --Ryan Mac Donald <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

321,Body Harvest,"['Cartridge and hard plastic collector case with reprint of original case artwork - NO MANUAL - Front label is fully in tact. Game cartridge is in good condition but may show normal signs of age such as minor scratches, discoloration, or debris in creases. All games are tested before being put into our inventory.', ""Playing DMA Design's Body Harvest is like taking the lead role in a BBC sci-fi TV series. The visuals may not be revolutionary, and the story may be a bit cheesy, but there's something unmistakably charming about the whole thing. <P>Anyway, analogy aside, you're a super-soldier who's traveled back in time to put down the initial invading forces of an alien race that's ravaged your era's earth. This plays out into a game that's not easy to describe, save for the fact that it has a few graphical and gameplay similarities to Rare's Blast Corps. You move about a variety of terrain piloting your little soldier man or sitting behind the controls of cars, tanks, planes, boats, and the like. Crucial points of gameplay are reached when a harvesting force of aliens takes on a nearby town. You then have to locate and destroy them before they gobble up six humans, which would produce a nigh-invulnerable mutant alien (that's a very bad thing). Encounters with smaller forces are frequent and pepper the parts of the game where you have to solve minor puzzles in order to move along. <P>From within the gameplay, Body Harvest is not much like anything else, actually. It's a slower-paced title, but not to the point of being boring. Its originality is refreshing (being able to flip from walking to manning a tank to flying a plane is pretty nice). The graphics are pretty bland at times, as one might expect from a much-delayed first-generation N64 game, and the lack of a look function dates it, but neither of these elements really gets in the way. The soundtrack, while limited and too often repeated, is atmospheric in an X-Files theme song sort of way. <P>Where some elements of the game teeter on the edge of slightly above average, pushing well above the median there's a good chunk of value to Body Harvest, as each stage is pretty big and requires a lot of work to beat. On the downside of that upside, the game only allows you to save once a major task is accomplished. This means that you may have played a certain section for an hour, made a wrong turn, ended up in a lake, drowned, and had to restart the stage. Or it might so happen that you play for an hour, get thrashed by a boss character, and have to start over again. And so on. Consider yourself warned: This sort of scenario can happen frequently (a happenstance that robbed the score of at least a point for the reviewer's tilt). <P>For gamers looking for something almost completely unique or even just a big, dumb game to fill the void before Zelda comes out, Body Harvest fits the bill nicely.  --Joe Fielder <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

322,Gex 3 Deep Cover Gecko,"['Get reacquainted with an all-new <I>GEX</I> and his ""Miss  Adventures."" The latest in the action jumping series includes new  character mechanics, including scuba diving, gliding, machine-gunning,  and fireball hurling. Take control of a variety of vehicles and  creatures, including military tanks, crocodiles, burros, and others.  <I>GEX</I> has over 25 new disguises, including Private Gex, Gex  Capone, and Count DracuGex. <i>Baywatch</i>\'s Marliece Andrada stars as  the beautiful Agent Xtra, spoofing buxom spy babes of the past. The new  3-D camera system guides you through highly detailed 3-D environments.  And over 1,000 celebrity impressions and wisecracks from comedian Dana  Gould help make for a worthy sequel.', 'Gex\'s problems with TV are seriously starting to affect his life. He\'s a secret agent who lives in his own high-tech spycave, but the only kind of case he ever seems to get entails collecting remote controls and entering television sets that transport him to strange new worlds. (Names like Invasion of the Body Slammers and Lake Flaccid speak for themselves.) In his latest adventure, he must rescue fellow agent X-Tra (Baywatch\'s Marliece Andrada, whose presence here screams, ""You\'re being marketed to, little boy."") from his long-standing enemy, Rez. In typical third-season fashion, the makers of a hit series aren\'t straying too far from formula, and you can tell that, like Gary Coleman in Diff\'rent Strokes, Gex is having a tough time showing off his range. <P>As mentioned before, Gex enters differently themed worlds where he must accomplish a number of tasks before receiving a remote-control prize (there are four per stage). The more controllers he gets, the more worlds he can enter. Gex gets around by running, jumping, bouncing on his tail, climbing grooved walls with his sticky gecko feet, and leaping with a karate kick. That kick can also be used against enemies, as can the tail bounce, tail swipe, and his spit after he swallows special power-ups.  <P>Probably the signature feature of the Gex series is that comedian Dana Gould spits TV- and movie-related one-liners throughout. While the jokes were an inventive feature in the first Gex game, they\'ve since gotten really tired. The writers behind Dana Gould\'s quips simply seem as though they\'ve run out of ideas. The comments are a lot less Austin Powers-obsessed than they were in Enter the Gecko, but you\'ll still be thankful for the option to turn them down or off. <P>The game engine behind Gex 3 is indubitably the little engine that could. It\'s responsible for Gex: Enter the Gecko, Akuji the Heartless, this game, and the upcoming Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver, too. Each game has seen its own modifications; this one obviously has the most in common with the last Gex game, the main difference being the improved game camera. Graphically, it looks much the same as before, maybe with a little less pop-up and slowdown, though both are still present. You now have more control over modifying your perspective, and the intelligent camera is better, but the views are still nowhere as tight as in Insomniac\'s Spyro the Dragon or Rare\'s Banjo-Kazooie. Specifically, it can still be terribly difficult to judge distance and depth from your viewpoint, sometimes making 3D-platform jumps a grueling proposition. This doesn\'t come up a great deal of the time, since there\'s a surprisingly small amount of platform jumping in this platform game, but when it appears, it can be a real teeth gnasher. The developers seem to have realized this because once you get further into levels like Little Red Riding in the Hood and Cut Cheese Island, shortcuts appear. So, if you miss a jump, you won\'t lose too much ground. But the final stage, where you hop from satellite to rotating satellite on your way to battle Rez, is a perspective nightmare, with dark textures on top of a dark background.  <P>Visual gripes aside, the game is more fun than its predecessor. Gex\'s new outfits often provide him with new abilities. For instance, when he\'s wearing a vampire\'s cape or Little Red Riding Hood\'s hood, he can glide. When he has a pirate\'s hook, he can use it to slide down ropes. There are also minigames that place him in a kangaroo\'s pouch or in a tank. These elements may sound lame on paper, but they do break things up nicely. This, along with the improved level design, make the game addictive enough that you\'ll want to play it through, and maybe even go back and discover everything there is to find within.  <P>Gex 3 is enough of an improvement over the last game that fans of the previous one should enjoy it even more, but with the leaps we\'ve seen in 3D PlayStation platformers over the last year (read: Spyro the Dragon), it comes off feeling a bit dated. It\'s essentially a fun game, but one that ends up taking up residence in the badlands between a rent and a buy recommendation. So, in short, Gex has become a little more refined, but less original at the same time. --Steven Garrett <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

323,Myst - PlayStation,"[""One of the best-selling computer games of all time, Myst caused quite a sensation when it was released in September, 1993. Several years later, it remains on best-seller lists and continues to generate lookalike games hoping to cash in on its widespread appeal. What's most confounding about Myst is its longevity. While an interesting game, it hardly warrants the fanaticism surrounding it - and this Playstation port does little to explain the phenomenon. <P>The premise is simple. The player must explore the island of Myst, researching the notes of a mysterious man named Atrus and his exploration of several distinct worlds. Through Atrus' notes, players find solutions to puzzles that open gateways to these worlds, which they then explore to unravel the mystery surrounding the disappearance of Atrus and his two sons, Sirrus and Achenar. The majority of the game is simply walking around the various locales, making connections between the cryptic information given and the puzzles presented. In this sense, Myst demands a great deal from the player - careful attention must be paid to the slightest details and copious notes must be taken at all times. <P>The wandering itself is not an unpleasant task - the much touted graphics really are spectacular (though the level of detail is not quite as rich in the Playstation version), even after three years and several dozen knock-offs. Even more incredible is the audio, with a great musical score and moody ambient sounds. But the joy of exploration eventually wears off, even after discovering a new world, and the stagnant nature of the game transforms this adventure into more of a relaxing slideshow than an engrossing adventure. <P>But three million Myst fans can't be all wrong. The game does hold some engaging puzzles, and the story unfolds just gradually enough to maintain your interest. On the downside, though, is the fact that Myst may have the single worst payoff in the history of games.

325,Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak,"['N64 Expansion Pack will extend the RAM of your console by 4MB of RAM.', 'The Expansion Pak allows the random access memory (RAM) of the Nintendo 64 console to increase from 4 megabytes (MB) to 8 MB of contiguous main memory. With the help of an included key, the Expansion Pak fits into the slot that is below a removable panel on the top of the N64 console. Game developers can take advantage of the increased memory in several ways, including making games that are more visually appealing. Some games will allow players to choose a ""high-resolution"" option, increasing the screen resolution from 320 by 240 pixels to as much as 640 by 480 pixels--creating crisp, high-definition graphics. The Expansion Pak utilizes Nintendo 64\'s capability for 32-bit, 16.7-million-color display with 256 levels of transparency (alpha)--bringing your games to a new level of realism. Instead of reusing texture data, games can buffer a larger number of textures for a more distinct look.', 'Other ways for developers to utilize the larger memory is by setting a higher frame rate, longer replays, and more animations. Games also can have more sophisticated artificial intelligence, which allows computer-controlled characters to be smarter, literally. Games can offer more characters and vehicles, and contain larger, more complex levels and worlds. Some games like <I>The Legend of Zelda: Majora\'s Mask</I> require the Expansion Pak, while others such as <I>Perfect Dark</I> require it for access to all of the game\'s levels and features. <a href=""/exec/obidos/tg/feature/-/45471/${0}"">See our list of Nintendo 64 games that take advantage of the Expansion Pak\'s extra power</a>.']"
326,Big Air Snowboarding,"['This game is complete in Big Air Half Pipe, Boardercross Freeride Race, and Freeride Trick events. Gearing up with real snowboard brands chalenging real pro-boarders.', 'The snowboarding genre is definitely one that could stand to have fewer games coming out. It\'s almost as bad as the shooter was in the 16-bit era. Everyone and his mama is developing a snowboarding game with little to differentiate it from the last one. Take Big Air, for instance. Certainly this is not an offensive game by any means, but it\'s remarkably average, it offers nothing that hasn\'t been done before, and it reeks of the ""me too"" syndrome publishers suffer from when a ""hot new genre"" establishes itself. <P>Since it was developed by Pitbull Syndicate, the wily mastermind behind Test Drive 4 and 5, you\'d think that another racing game would have been right up its collective alley. If you liked any of Pitbull\'s earlier games, you might prefer to pick this snowboarding game up, as opposed to, say, Cool Boarders 3 or Tricky Sliders. What you\'d be picking up, however, is an example of a lackluster game merely going through the motions. As usual, the typical options are included: half pipe, boardercross, slalom, and free ride. A mode called big air has been included, which is essentially just like the half-pipe mode except that you attempt to do your stunts on a long straightaway with a big jump at the end. Wheee! 30 unique courses in six international locations are allocated to you, so you can try your boarding trickery without becoming hopelessly bored by the ""same old, same old"" gameplay. To pique your interest, the game is filled with licensed snowboards and snowboarding gear (K2, Quicksilver, Morrow, and so on) to give it that real-life feel. If you have a friend who is willing to play alongside you, the obligatory split screen is included so you can ""thrash it out"" with a pal. <P>Unfortunately, even if all this truly tickled your fancy, the presentation will test your patience. In what is surely a ""love it or hate it"" affair, the game engine does the game no favors. With a merely acceptable frame rate and a grainy seaminess to it, the course graphics are second-generation PlayStation quality, at best. It hardly makes any difference that real-life pro snowboarders are included, since almost no one except for hard-core snowboarding aficionados would know who any of them are, especially since they are viewed from the backs of their heads. Course design is also fairly uninspired, with courses often being little more than straight runs down a snowy hill, with the occasional jutting rock or tree to indicate undulations. The control interface is pedestrian as well and offers no new gameplay revelations. How many ways can you expect to do 1080s and liens anyhow? <P>The last aggravating touch is the inclusion of the gratingest, thrashingest soundtrack yet known to man. Is it the absolute rule that games of an ""x-treme"" nature must be littered with music by bands of an equally ""x-treme"" nature? If bands like Leatherface, Snuff, and Caustic Notions turn your knobs, then this game might be right up your alley. If not, head straight for the options screen and turn the soundtrack off. Without musical accompaniment, you\'re left with decidedly average snowboarding sounds that swoosh and pfffft with the best of them. <P>In case you haven\'t figured it out by now, Big Air is nothing more than a rental, and surely one that will go back the next day at that. If you must have a snowboarding game and you don\'t own an N64, Cool Boarders 2 is still your best bet. Unless you need a game with oodles of licensed stuff (boards, clothes, bands, and so on) Big Air is nothing but hot air. Next! --James Mielke <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

332,Marvel Super Heroes Vs. Street Fighter,"['There have been several disagreements between the Marvel Superheroes and the Street Fighters. There are roomers but no one is sure what has ignited the feud. One thing is certain though it will not be settled by using diplomacy! The fiercest tag team fighting action taken straight from the fired-up arcade version is now available for your PSX. There will be no compromise no mercy and no remorse. This is no holds-barred 2D fighting like only Capcom can bring.', ""I've been a big fan of the Street Fighter series since its outset. And to be quite honest, playing Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter only reminds me of how great the series used to be. Sure, the game is mildly entertaining, but without the true tag team gameplay that the arcade version of the game had, it comes off as just another Street Fighter game with Marvel characters.  <P>The character roster totals out at 17, with nine from the Street Fighter universe and eight from Marvel. There are five modes of play including battle, versus, training, hero battle, and crossover. Battle and versus are your typical one- and two-player fighting game modes. Hero Battle is an endurance mode that separates the groups to see which has the stronger stable of fighters. Nothing special here. Crossover mode, however, is at least somewhat interesting. You see, in the original version of MSH vs. SF you could pick two fighters whom you could switch between at any time during the fight. This tag team style of fighting was first featured in the arcade version of X-Men vs. Street Fighter but couldn't make it into the PlayStation port due to the technical limitations of the PlayStation. Sadly, the tag team aspect of MSH vs. SF was also excluded for the same reason. Sure, you can still pick two characters, but you can only play as one of them. The second character only comes into play when you execute a team combo or team counter. Crossover mode tries to bring the game's main selling point home. This mode allows you to pick two characters, then the computer uses the same characters you picked. This limits the amount of information the PlayStation has to handle to two characters instead of four. If you are victorious in this battle, the computer swaps one of the characters each of you have for another. This is done so that you aren't playing with and against the same two characters each fight. It gives you the tag team experience of the arcade, but having to deal with the rotating character thing and having to fight mirror images of yourself is extremely weak.  <P>Visually, MSH vs. SF looks good. But when you compare it with its arcade counterpart, it simply fails. The colors aren't nearly as vibrant, and the game suffers from quite a bit of slowdown. It still comes across better than the PlayStation version of X-Men vs. Street Fighter, though, because not nearly as much animation was cut out. This is a major plus, since frames of animation not only affect the game's appearance but timing and gameplay as well. <P>On the gameplay side, Street Fighter fans will definitely feel the typical Street Fighter gameplay. But in the end, it's all a question of how starved you are for another Street Fighter game. Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter is all about the tag team mode, and with the overall exclusion of this mode, Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter is just another Street Fighter game. --Ryan Mac Donald <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

333,Bust-A-Move '99,"['Game Cartridge ONLY. No box or instruction manual included. Game and label are in very good condition, game is tested and works great.', ""Acclaim's Bust-A-Move 99 brought little to the series on the PlayStation, aside from a hefty collection of homemade puzzles and a sparsely entertaining edit mode. However, the Taito-created Nintendo 64 version of essentially the same game delivers what most puzzles game fans want most - more in terms of multiplayer mode, along with a few additional features added since Acclaims Bust-A-Move 2 Arcade Edition that came out on the N64 this time last year - namely, a collection, a four-player mode, and an edit mode. There are five modes of play in all. Arcade mode is the arcade conversion of Bust-A-Move 3, with a puzzle option, in which a single player works through the levels without an opponent, neither human nor CPU. There is also a player vs. computer mode, and a player vs. player mode for two-player challenges. The challenge mode is a single-player match where you solve about 25 puzzles. Your success will be evaluated at the end. The win contest mode is another player vs. CPU game. The collection mode is basically what you saw (or might have seen) in Natsume's Bust-A-Move 3. A bunch of people of no discernable age made puzzles for Taito, and more than one thousand of these ended up in the final game. These puzzles usually take just seconds each to get through, and a good handful of them require little more than one to four shots (or turns) to complete. The ones that take longer seem nearly impossible, poorly constructed, and are likely the craftwork of some mean, disturbed little child with a vengeance. The good thing is, you don't have to complete one collection puzzle to move on to the next. You can sample them all and simply skip the ones you don't like.  <P>The last option in the N64 version, like in the PlayStation game, is the edit mode. The puzzle-building components aren't exactly complex, but they can be quite addictive. You select from a handful of primary and secondary colors, then throw in clear bubbles, stars, block bubbles, and so on. The screen can be adjusted for wide-screen or regular play, and you can save about 25 of your puzzles to a memory card to progressively work through. The interface for constructing puzzles is basic and intuitive, and it is actually pretty fun to try to determine what makes for a good puzzle - easy or difficult. The problem is, it's just as easy to construct a simple puzzle that brings bubbles smashing down in two moves as it is to build an extremely difficult puzzle by alternating colors and never grouping two together - which can be disappointing. <P>Where Bust-A-Move 99 for the N64 really shines is in the three- or four-player modes. These modes are engaging enough to keep you playing after you've long since tired of a simple two-player game. One complaint, however, is that (in what appears to be an obvious developer oversight) you're stuck with four game spaces on the TV monitor, whether you're in a three-player or four-player game. Because of this, the screens are really tiny, with silly pictures of your respective character under your playing space taking up about one fifth of your panel of the monitor. This makes no sense. Clearly, resolution issues were at play, but why not just present three spaces for a three-player game?                    The N64 version, like the PlayStation game, suffered from the occasional cluttered background, making the bubbles occassionally difficult to see. However, this wasn't consistently the case and therefore didn't really damage gameplay. And aside from a few sound glitches between levels, the cartridge didn't do much to damage the music. Could it, anyway?  <P>A minor, yet positive, note: Taito held on to the subtle control feature introduced in Bust-A-Move 2 for the N64. That is, besides analog/digital control options, you can use the left and right shoulder buttons to move the bubble projector ever so slightly, as opposed to a complete move with the stick or the D-pad. The game is Rumble Pak compatible, too. <P>So really, the way to play Bust-A-Move 99 on the N64 and get the most out of it is to play the four-player mode (just sit close to the TV) and learn the characters well. Bubbloon is no doubt the most charismatic of the lot, but the other characters have pretty decent fighting patterns, so to speak. For example, SSB will drop sets of and Jack will drop the tough to dispel rainbows and the impossible to rid blocks on your partner every time you clear a set or more of bubbles. When you're playing against three other players, each with different characters, learning and following the strategies of each adds a lot of value to the game.  <P>Overall, Bust-A-Move 99 for the N64, like the PlayStation version, is neither a revolutionary take on puzzle games nor a unique take on its own series. Yet it's a good game that will likely satisfy fans of the arcade game, as well as puzzle-game fans in general. If you have both systems and you're considering which version to buy, choose this one because of the multiplayer mode - the Nintendo 64 library is not brimming with cool multiplayer puzzle games. If you aren't familiar with the series, you don't have a PlayStation, and you simply want to know if it's worth your while, you can't go wrong picking this one up. --Lauren Fielder <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

334,Rollcage,"[""<I>Rollcage</I> somehow manages to inject new life into a tired old game genre with  glistening, spunky graphics, outrageous power-ups, and indestructible cars that bounce, but don't break.

Players can flip the cars completely over and continue driving,  unscathed."", ""<I>Rollcage</I>'s disregard for normal laws of physics means players can drive up rounded tunnel walls,  scaling the ceiling at speeds well over 300 mph. But this game is no walk in the park. The uniquely adept  computer opponents can quickly usurp your lead, sending you from first place to last. This phenomenon is  due mostly to the clever power-ups in the game that are designed to thwart the competition.

335,In The Zone '99,"['This classic NBA title is back and improved with all new AI. Alone or with friends this sure to be a slam dunk fest. Choose from your favorite all-star players and enjoy the real life rivalaries. Actual player attributes and signiture moves but you in the middle of the NBA action. Take it strong to the whole and let the trash tallking begin!', 'If head coaches have nightmares, they probably look a lot like the games played in NBA In the Zone \'99. Although this PlayStation game offers crisp graphics and a few new additions, its highly questionable AI makes offense a breeze and defense a joke at all difficulty levels. Those coaches who stress that defense wins ball games may want to stop reading here. <P>From a features standpoint, this game matches up evenly with its competitors. Aside from the expected exhibition, season, and playoff modes, the game also has a three-point contest and a new-to-the-genre slam-dunk competition. The three-point tournament requires quick reflexes: You match a rising cursor with a ""hot zone"" that shrinks as the competition goes on - mildly fun, if a bit on the easy side. Oddly, the size of that ""hot zone"" isn\'t determined by a player\'s season shooting stats, which would\'ve made more sense. The slam-dunk competition is a disappointment, as success depends on memorizing and regurgitating random button sequences. It would\'ve been more appealing if it injected reflex-testing gameplay into the mix. <P>This game also delivers plenty of now-standard game options: everything from an extensive create-a-player menu to a choice of ball color so you can see it better. It also has updated 1999 NBA rosters, except for several notable late trades (such as game endorser Glen Rice\'s move to the Los Angeles Lakers). <P>The well-drawn graphics are perhaps the game\'s strongest point, especially in the dunks and instant replays. Nifty animations for knocked-down players and slingshot passes add visual flavor. Like the Nintendo 64 version, it offers a fully adjustable camera that zooms and tilts to offer the best view, which helps tailor the game to any gamer\'s preferences. While sparse, the stadium commentary by ex-Chicago Bulls announcer Ray Clay makes the grade. <P>However, no matter how good a game looks, it\'s the AI that makes or breaks a basketball game. Sadly, players will quickly see instances of gameplay suitable for a hoops-themed sequel of Dumb and Dumber. On fast breaks, the computer pulls up even though it has numbers. On scoring drives, the computer passes or freezes despite having a wide-open lane to the basket. The computer refuses to foul late in a game and goes for two points even though it needs three to tie - even during playoff games! <P>It gets worse when it comes to defensive AI, which can be most colorfully described as chickens with their heads cut off. Players run in circles and refuse to offer help when a teammate\'s burned - they won\'t even turn to watch the basket scored on them! Plus, the computer rarely misses at tougher difficulty levels, so solid defense isn\'t rewarded. Fortunately, the AI is horrible at defense against human players, so it\'s possible to rock the computer\'s world with a good three-point shooter such as Reggie Miller. This essentially turns games into offensive clinics, with plenty of dunks and easy shots - fun that\'s hardly real and gets tired quickly. <P>The laundry list of AI flaws extends to one innovative yet ineffective gameplay nuance. When players meet, they get into a lock-up animation as they push for position. It\'s possible to use this animation to push a computer dribbler out of bounds, or prevent a player from stymieing the AI. It\'s effectively legal holding, which doesn\'t seem fair. <P>Rather than offering extensive playbooks as in the Nintendo 64 version, the game gives wannabe coaches generic play sets and team-strategy meters. The latter tells the computer players if they should focus on fast breaks, defense, rebounding, and so on. If that weren\'t enough, you can adjust the degrees of defense on individual matchups. Although the play sets help to a degree, the team strategies and individual defense options seem to have no effect on altering the already shaky AI, reducing whatever usefulness they may have to spicing up gameplay. <P>If players are willing to forgive its various AI flaws, NBA In the Zone \'99 may have some multiplayer value. But with so many smarter, better-playing NBA video games available for the PlayStation, it\'s hard to recommend this one, no matter how good it may look. --Nelson Taruc <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

The original NHL Hockey was such a good game, that it actually turned me into a hockey fan. How has the series held up over the years? Pretty well. There have been a few versions that have left out the casual sports gamer, taking a more complex route. NHL 99 retains the outstanding gameplay of the original 16-bit games, but gives you lots of options, allowing you make the game as simple or as complex as you want.', ""For starters, you can disable just about all the rules, including icing, two-line passes, offsides, and those pesky interference calls. Other options include player trading, which also includes the ability to make your own players. Gameplay modes include all the modes we've come to expect from modern-day sports titles. Exhibition games allow you to dive right in and play a meaningless game, while season mode and championship mode allow you to give your games a little more meaning. There is also a shootout mode, which allows you to practice your breakaways in a penalty shot competition."", ""The gameplay is extremely simple to learn, though there are advanced options that you can learn, also. At its most simplistic, NHL 99 requires the use of only three buttons. However, decide to control your own goalie, call some offensive or defensive plays, or change lines, and you'll find that the game can get really complex. Still, the control is really great. The analog controller really allows for precision skating. The AI in the game (based on last year's PlayStation version) is reasonably good and scales pretty well to fit the difficulty setting."", 'The graphics in NHL 99 work really well. The skating and checking animations are all pretty nice, and the game runs at a nice, smooth frame rate. The sound, unfortunately, doesn\'t come off as well. Sure, the actual sounds of hockey are pretty good, but the announcer really kills it. It seems like he only says about eight different things. Even though it was recorded by NHL analyst, Bill Clement, it still sounds like EA called in one of the night janitors at the eleventh hour to record things like ""freight train...woo wooooo!""', ""NHL 99 provides a great gameplay experience for both fans and nonfans of the sport. It is simple enough for anyone to pick up and play, yet there's enough here to keep you interested for a long time.

The Dual Shock analog support really gives you the feel of gliding down the ice. In addition, now when you collide with a player on the ice or smash into the glass, the controller vibrates. You can still use the digital pad of course, but the smooth nature of the analog controller really does lend itself perfectly to skating."", ""Graphically, NHL 99 isn't leaps and bounds better, but it is a little cleaner. The frame rate is still pretty bad, but it doesn't hinder the game too much. EA wanted the animation of the players on the ice to be as true to life as possible, so it went and got real NHL players to provide the motion for the skating and goalie animations in the game. The result is a smoother, more accurate look to the players' movements than has been seen previously."", 'The play-by-play calls and commentary from NHL broadcasters Daryl Reaugh and Jim Hughson really add some flavor to the game, as does the stadium announcer, who calls out over the PA every once in a while to tell you how tasty the food is at the snack bar. The best one we\'ve heard thus far went something like, ""Would the person that left the brown paper bag next to the concession stand filled with nonsequential one hundred dollar bills, a ski mask, and a gun please come to the security office.""', 'AI has always been one of the key points of the NHL series, and this year is no exception.

This is EA\'s first N64 version of Live, and the result is a pretty good game with a lot of options.', ""Like previous Lives, you can customize just about every feature, right down to which fouls get called and which are ignored. So you can make the game as complex as the real thing or strip it down to the basics and play it like a five-on-five version of NBA Jam. An arcade setting turns on superhuman dunks, burning hoops, and incredibly stupid cartoon noises to accompany gameplay. Aside from the usual exhibition, season, and play-off games, there is also a three-point shooting contest, reminiscent of the one found in EA's classic Jordan vs. Bird: One on One. On the managerial side, you can trade and release players, making them free agents, to build your own superteam. You can also create players at will to place on your modified teams."", 'The gameplay is standard for the genre. You can play it with two or three buttons, but every single button on the controller does something. So if you want to pull off advanced maneuvers, they\'re reasonably easy to execute. Icon passing and defensive player selection are in the game, and you can call different offensive and defensive sets. You can, of course, leave the play calling to the computer if you wish. The AI of your teammates is pretty good. They\'ll shuffle around the court in an attempt to get open, and they\'ll defend the basket pretty well, though they aren\'t aggressive enough to get many steals. The opposing team AI ranges from moronic (rookie) to ""just set the controller down, because you don\'t have a chance"" (superstar).', 'The graphics in Live are nice, although the animation looks a little jerky. Sound-wise, Live is great, with the exception of the (thankfully) easily disabled arcade mode sounds. The cartoon running and bouncing noises are incredibly lame. The commentary is sparse, but well timed, and is about par for the course considering the limitations of the cartridge format.', 'NBA Live 99 has enough options and tweaks to allow anyone to play it. New players can pick it up, learn a couple of buttons, and do reasonably well against the computer, while longtime fans of Live can pick this one up and fall right into their old ways.

352,Point Blank 2,"['If you\'ve ever played the arcade version of Namco\'s Point Blank (or Gun Bullet, as it\'s called in Japan) or the import version for the PlayStation, then you likely know just how many tokens you can go through or how many restarts you initiate in a very short amount of time. This puzzle/shooter title, which sometimes unmercifully lets you have only one bullet and five seconds to complete a task, can be replayed free, endlessly, and to perfection, as it\'s now available for the Sony PlayStation - in English. <P>Point Blank portrays the story of two gun-slinging companeros and adventurers, Dr. Don and Dr. Dan, who look amazingly like Sesame Street\'s Bert and Ernie after a healthy dose of Rogaine and about 20 years hard time. You adopt their collective identity throughout the single-player and two-player head-to-head score-battle mode. Once you select your experience level, beginner, intermediate, or expert, get comfortable with and calibrate your GunCon, as this is the third US title to be compatible with the accurate-within-three-pixels light gun. From this point, a jumble of four distinct challenges from within a larger grouping will be presented to you. Select one of them, and the game starts. <P>There\'s no logical progression to the difficulty of these levels, as they each tend to measure a different skill set. Some of them, for example, test your accuracy by giving you a single bullet and ten seconds to shoot an apple off a guy\'s head or blast a feather floating down from the sky. The expert level may find you trying the same task with less available time or perhaps an object moving more quickly. Other stages may test your speed and judgment - making you shoot scores of ""bad guys"" or ninjas within a given time limit. You\'ll have unlimited ammo on these levels, but rapid fire won\'t help you. You see, there are civilians you must avoid, or you\'ll lose a life for each one you kill. And generally, unless you change things around in the options menu, you only live thrice. Another grouping of levels encourages rapid fire. In these challenges, you\'ll have a varying time limit and an unlimited amount of ammunition to either do such things as totally destroy a sports car or shoot a bunch of bottles off the wall. Still another skill test is the target objective. Marks in the pattern of plates or shooting-range forms will be displayed to you, and you\'ll have a time limit and occasionally an ammo allotment to complete your goal. For example, you must shoot down all plates of a certain color, while avoiding ""bomb"" decoys, or hit a bull\'s-eye to secure a high score. <P>You won\'t always be reaching for a numerical score rewarding target accuracy or destroying the appropriate number of objects. You\'ll also have puzzles and missions to conquer - with your gun (who said violence couldn\'t solve problems?). This might entail shooting the keys of a keyboard to spell out words; figuring out which part of the fast-moving Chinese dragon to hit; determining which bouncing balls to cap to clear the lot of them; shooting out a numerical sequence from a scrambled keypad; annihilating all the vultures, piranhas, tanks, meteorites, and fireballs before they exterminate your buddy; and knocking the hives off a tree before killing all the bees. And if after all this you haven\'t had enough diversity, various Whack-a-Mole-style levels will prompt you to shoot cuckoo clock birds and fuzzy animals as they emerge and disappear - rather quickly - in and out of their abodes, tag-teaming with bombs that will tempt your anxious reflexes. <P>The stages are incredibly irresistible and fun, luring you into a seemingly endless stream of continues until you either succeed at a challenge or get a red flag for that level and move on to the next. If you fail, you\'ll lose one life and continue with the set until you\'re dead. Whether you win or lose a level, you\'ll get a certain number of points for how hard you tried (or how long you managed to stay alive). Once you finish four levels, you\'ll get four more until you either die or the difficulty level is complete - at which point, you fight the final battle and disappear into a flurry of fireworks and adulation when you win. <P>Single-player and head-to-head score competitions aside, Point Blank for the PlayStation tops the arcade version by offering tournament and team-play modes, in which up to four players compete in turn-based rounds of the previously listed levels until either a team or an individual wins. A special mode offers variations on the already disparate stages, and a quest mode extends RPG-like play - much in the style of Soul Blade, where you (as the team of Dr. Dan and Dr. Don) collect experience points and money for battles you encounter as you wander around a tropical oasis called Point Blank Island. The point of this quest is to beat Quickbuck, the evil head of the Scrimp \'n\' Save Corporation, to the Gunball. You do this by succeeding at a series of shooting challenges, basically variations on the stages from other modes, and you encounter them as you explore a 2D environment. Quest mode is definitely a fast-moving RPG, but it pretty much has to be, as who wants to hold his arms poised to shoot for hours on end? The translations in quest mode are a little rough, too, as you\'re told to ""best"" certain bosses, not ""beat"" them, as well as test your ""shoothing"" skills. But this is not a puzzle game disguised as an RPG, as the RPG standards, such as purchasable rejuvenating potions (in the form of hamburgers, here) and stepped-up weapons and so on, are all components of the Point Blank Quest.  <P>Point Blank\'s graphics are nothing to chirp about, and the music sounds like it comes from a kid-weary shopping-mall floor-sample synthesizer. But amazingly, Namco\'s managed to capture and apply the addictive elements of puzzle and shooting games, creating a title that is so enjoyable and difficult to put down you won\'t be bothered by the audiovisual shortcomings. --Lauren Fielder <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

It hit Mega Man in the Japanese release Rockman: Battle & Chase and Square's cutesy-cutesy Chocobo in Chocobo Racing. It's even happened to Mario twice now. Since Bomberman has long been known to play with fire and explosives, it was really just a matter of time before he added the track to his long list of vices. <P>So, this is where it's all gotten him. The bomb-chucking star of Hudson's genre-defying series and several of his friends have saddled up on Tiras (the worried-looking hippo-dinosaur hybrids) and Louies (the excitable kangaroo creatures introduced several games back), and they are competing in races for money and fame. In the single-player mode, you race against four opponents, drop or throw bombs at them, and use power-ups found along the way. (Just about everything is here, from power bombs to triple bombs; plus, there are a few new items as well). Using a feature available in a number of Japan-only horseracing video games, you can make your mount sprint ahead for short distances until it tires. If you come in first, second, or third, you'll get cash. Make enough, and you can buy extra power-ups, better Tiras and Louies, and gain entrance into the next race. In the two-player split-screen mode, you can make a bet and race against a friend. <P>The graphics are a bit plain for this generation of PlayStation games, and pop-up and build are an issue, of course, but it's not a horrible-looking game. The music in BFR alternates between sounding like a speeded-up tape and an imported electronic toy - ultimately, these sounds earn the game points for quirkiness. Altogether, the game's not very long, very good, or very bad - which at least wins it the dubious distinction of being the best Bomberman game on the PlayStation to date. If you're a fan of Bomberman or Mario Kart, it's worth renting, but it's a little too short, and the tracks are a little too simple to warrant a more long-term relationship. --Joe Fielder <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Now Point Blank 2, the shoot-\'em-up puzzle sequel has arrived in the States. The game, like its Japanese counterpart, is not an arcade port, but rather a console-specific game geared expressly to the home audience. How does it fare? Very well indeed. Point Blank 2 is a toughened up a step beyond the Japanese version, yet it includes the same modes, such as a theme-park mode in place of the RPG-like storyline of the first game. There\'s also a party mode with a two-to-four-player tournament, a team battle, a really fun turf war, and the Point Blank Castle, which includes versus and endurance modes. Theoretically, in single-player and multiplayer modes, you have the same sort of timed ""target"" challenges that the first game offered. These challenges test your ability to shoot straight and often in rapid succession, with limited time, ammo, or both. In single player, you can start off with a training mode that recommends the next stage you should try - depending on how well you do, of course. The practice levels are painfully easy and often suggest you go to an advanced round next, but then the advanced levels will beat you soundly and suggest you go back to beginner. As in the Japanese game, the practice level has four rounds, and the beginner and advanced levels each have 16. And as an added bonus, a new ""insane"" level has been thrown in to up the ante. Once you complete a stage, you receive stats that track your progress, from accuracy to speed of firing. The trick is to make it through all of the courses, finishing each successfully. Also in single player, the theme park mode is much more enjoyable than Point Blank Island was in the first game. As the hero (a young kid with a big gun) in theme-park mode, you must search the park for the king\'s daughter and clear all the stages before you can complete the level. As in the first game, the puzzles in this mode are similar to puzzles in the multiplayer and single-player modes, but with a bit more diversity in their delivery.  Overall, the stages in Point Blank 2 exhibit a greater degree of depth than the original game did. For example, instead of just clearing the bad guys and saving the good guys, you now have bottles sprinkled throughout the level to grab for extra points. Also, the bad guys don\'t just dress the sidewalks, porches, and hallways; now they actually ride by you in buses and truck beds. You get to shoot out the glass of the vehicles before capping the bandit! Clever new puzzles such as one in which you shoot the cork off a champagne bottle and defuse a time bomb make you wonder if the developers had concocted these puzzles by sitting on lawn chairs on their back porches with their BB guns. The vandal levels have expanded as well. Now you shoot out neon signs in Tokyo and destroy a house and tractor with rapid fire. You\'ll even shear sheep with a gun. Pretty slick. But the list of new stages goes on and on (between the original version and the Japanese version of the sequel as well), and they\'re all just as fun, if not more fun, than the original. One thing to note - besides having a greater degree of depth, Point Blank 2 is also considerably more difficult than Point Blank. As expected, the multiplayer mode is even better. This time, you can challenge other players in real-time one-on-one battles. You\'ll have races to destroy the targets or shear the same herd of sheep. Another multiplayer stage finds you knocking off vultures so your character can beat your opponent\'s character to the mountaintop.  The tournament mode is essentially a larger, more focused head-to-head mode, but the team play is quite fun. However, the best new mode has to be the turf war. Up to four players battle for blocks on a layout of a couple dozen squares. The player with the most squares in the end wins. You earn squares by selecting an opponent\'s square and challenging that person to a match. The puzzles you play here are the same puzzles you play throughout the various modes in the game. Graphically, Point Blank 2 is a bit better than Point Blank, and the music is slightly improved as well, offering less of a Casio keyboard sound and more of what could be more aptly referred to as ""penguin techno,"" although it seems that some of the same tunes have returned, and they haven\'t evolved in the least.  The Point Blank 2 challenges have greater depth, they are more difficult, and, in part, they are more sophisticated - you\'ll rely less on your reflexes and more on hard-core hand-eye coordination and your brain - at one point you\'ll have to complete math problems and shoot the correct answers. This game is just as addictive as Point Blank, yet it has greater difficulty and strategy elements, along with the new modes, making the experience one step beyond mesmerizing and quite an authentic challenge. Fans of Point Blank will certainly not be disappointed, and those who thought Point Blank was a bit too remedial will probably feel right at home.<i>--Lauren Fielder</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

355,R4: Ridge Racer Type 4 - PlayStation PS1,"[""It is speed incarnate. Its sexy sheet metal restrains a 3000 CC power plant that hits 0-190 MPH in a snap of a linguini. It is the Bisonrte - just one of the automotive marvels the scorch the streets in Ridge Racer Type 4. With over 300 new cars 45 fantastic models 8 thrilling courses a 2-player split-screen mode there is only one way to drive...fast. R4's asphalt gulping graphics and spectacular racing environments deliver racing speeds that were once deemed impossible."", ""No matter how great you think Gran Turismo, Need for Speed, or any other driving game is, Ridge Racer has always been the preferred series when it comes to arcade-style driving. Though Rage Racer introduced some simulation aspects off the track, the on-track experience maintained the same powerslide-happy gameplay that PlayStation owners have loved since the system launched. Ridge Racer Type 4 (or R4, for short) makes plenty of improvements while maintaining the same basic feel. <P>The game's main mode is the grand prix, where you pick one of four teams and one of four car manufacturers, then race on eight tracks. Each team has its own little storyline that plays out between races, which is told through conversation with your team liaison. What your team liaison says to you changes depending on how well you do. The first two tracks only require you to place third or higher. The second heat requires you to finish second or higher, while the last four tracks require you to finish first to proceed. You can retry each track up to three times before having to start the entire heat over again. You'll earn a newer, faster car as you complete in each heat and one more before the final race. Which car you get depends on how well you did in the previous races. If you aced the entire heat, and you'll get a faster, better car than you would if you'd finished third in one or more races. These cars can be used in the two-player versus mode or the time-trial mode. Also, an extra trial is unlocked for each car manufacturer as you beat the game with the various cars. <P>There are two basic types of cars in the game. Drift cars are meant for powersliding, while the grip cars use their additional traction to make most turns without needing to lay down any rubber. The drift cars can maneuver the courses more quickly than the grip cars, but the grip cars let you compete, even though you might not have mastered the art of the slide. Also, Namco's Jogcon controller really brings a lot to the game. The addition of the small wheel makes the control a lot more intuitive, as well as providing valuable feedback (start doing thumb exercises now) that helps you know exactly when to power out of a turn. The track design still revolves around making only a few different tracks, and using variations to deliver different courses, but the rehashing of tracks doesn't stand out nearly as much as it did in the previous Ridge Racer games. <P>The graphics are simply great. The game moves at a very high, smooth frame rate, and the tracks are filled with detail. Lighting is also well used, and things like brake lights give off tracers in tunnels. The graphics aren't perfect, though. You can sometimes see the opposing cars through walls, and the brake lights occasionally appear in the road if you're approaching the top of a hill and another car is near the bottom of the hill. The soundtrack is a bit more mellow than the previous games, but it still fits into the game perfectly. <P>Above all, R4 is incredibly fun to play. Unlocking the cars (more than 300 in all, though most are basic variations on a few common themes) quickly becomes an obsession, and the Jogcon adds a ton of depth to the game's control. Sure, you can play with a Dual Shock or even a standard controller, but the Jogcon is definitely the way to play. If you've ever cared about any of the games in the Ridge Racer series, then R4 is definitely the racing game for you. --Jeff Gerstmann <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

356,Duke Nukem: Total Meltdown,"['The King of 3D action is coming to the PlayStation with a new purebred shooter overload of graphically-enhanced bigger meaner extraterrestrial exterminating fun. Duke Nukem is looking as good as ever as he blasts enemies and spouts one-liners. Over 40 huge levels with tons of monsters await Duke on his mission: kill everything in sight! Over a dozen hi-tech weapons including shotguns machine guns rocket launchers and grenades help Duke deal with those bad aliens. There is even 2 player split-screen action featuring Dukematch co-op team-play and all-new Meltdown modes.', 'Considering the fact that 3D Realms released the shareware version of Duke Nukem 3D in early \'96, this PlayStation version feels like a blast from the past. Still, when it comes to the would-be king of first-person shooters, you can bet that people will be ready to ""come get some,"" no matter what time or which platform. <P>Everyone who watches the evening news knows that sex and violence sells. Hence, The 17+ warning and lurid screenshots on the Duke Nukem jewel case become an alluring advertisement for what\'s inside. The little black CD fits all three ""episodes"" from the original game and throws in a final episode to keep things interesting. Playing through the game, Duke visits a host of cheesy locales, including strip bars and skin-flick theatres, eventually finding himself aboard a giant space station. Each soda machine, movie poster, magazine rack, and barroom is luxuriously appointed with beautiful textures, making environments fresh each time you round a corner. Of course, beauty isn\'t necessarily a protective quality, as you\'ll quickly find that most objects can be obliterated with a couple of properly aimed gun blasts. <P>Weapons exhibit an ingenuity that surpasses the Doom model of simply raising the caliber with each new gun. For example, Duke can lob a pipe bomb and wait to detonate it when an unsuspecting creature approaches, or he can reduce befuddled foes to a squashable size with a shrinker gun. There are also original items that can be picked up, such as the jetpack, which gives Duke the power to fly around freely until his jets have cooled. When the novelty of these implements of destruction begins to get old, however, the game as a whole begins to cool down.  <P>First of all, the monsters appear markedly dated. LAPD piggies, flying brains, and spastic, machine gun-wielding aliens are among the humorous nasties you\'ll meet, but their sprite-based 2D rendering makes the action a little flat. When you combine this with the fact that the animations of fiery explosions and pulpifying creatures seem to be sorely lacking in frames (as compared with the PC version), you may question why Duke ever decided to make another platform jump. <P>What\'s more, only three set control configurations are offered. Control style can vary greatly from player to player, especially in first-person shooters. Given this, most people may never get their coordination entirely up to speed in Duke Nukem before another, more option-rich shooter comes along for the PlayStation.  <P>If you want to duke it out deathmatch-style in Total Meltdown, you\'re out of luck unless you have two PlayStations. Why 3D Realms didn\'t allow for players to have a slug fest on one machine, or even include AI ""bots"" to use as target practice (as it did with the N64 version), remains a mystery. <P>Duke Nukem remains a classic game for the PC. Running on a PlayStation, the game suffers from sketchy graphics and limited control. If nothing else, this PlayStation version will give non-PC owners a chance to sample 3D Realms\' ridiculous world of blood and lace.  --Tim Soete <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

A secret world that lies beneath all the fighting games, sports games, and that cute little music game you bought last year. That world is the world of fishing games. <P>People have been making fishing games for a long, long time. One of the earliest examples of a fishing game is Fishing Derby for the Atari 2600. Fisherman's Bait, while significantly more complex than Fishing Derby, also takes a stripped-down approach to the world of fishing. But what this arcade port loses in realism, it makes up for in entertainment. <P>There are a few different modes to choose from in Fisherman's Bait. The beginner mode teaches you how to use the game's controls in an easy, well-stocked lake. Training mode lets you pick one of the game's three main lakes and simply fish. Versus mode allows you and a friend to have a fish-off to see who can get the most bass. Tournament mode is the game's main mode. Here, you play through all three of the lakes. Each lake has a qualifying run and an actual tournament. To qualify for the tournament, you must catch a fish that is heavier than the qualification weight. The tournament itself is a ten-minute event. You must catch the three heaviest bass you can find. To catch fish, you've got several lures and several different lake locations to choose from. Knowing which lure to use, how to use it, and where to use it is the key to getting fish to bite, but keeping them on the hook is entirely up to you. Once they're hooked, you've got to reel them in. Usually, there isn't much of a fight, but the huge fish can be really hard to land. As you reel, you've got to watch the tension gauge. If it gets too high, your line will snap and the fish will escape. So as it gets up there, you've got to release the tension and let them run a little bit. After you've tired the fish out, they aren't too hard to land. <P>Since it's an arcade port, you've also got to contend with a separate timer. Each fish you catch gives you a little more time on your game timer. If it runs out, you'll have to use a credit to continue. The options screen lets you set it up for infinite credits, though, so this isn't really a large worry. <P>While Fisherman's Bait is a reasonably fun game, it really isn't worth more than a rental to most. There is, after all, a reason why fishing games have remained a deep, dark secret. However, if you latched onto the arcade version, or if fishing games are just your bag, then by all means, pick it up. --Jeff Gerstmann <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Arcade-baseball game fans are sure to love it, although fans who prefer a more balanced simulation-style game should look elsewhere. <P>The overall presentation, control scheme, and basic feel of the game all center around ease of play. With three levels of difficulty and four different modes to play, there's more than enough to keep you busy for awhile. In addition, this year's game features a create-a-player mode that lets you build 20 different players. <P>The control scheme is set up, for the most part, just like last year's game. The default batting system features the target cursor, which you must place over a small box that indicates where the pitch is headed. In addition, there is classic, a second batting option, which takes away the batting cursor and lets you simply time the pitch. These two different styles of batting are great in games where players of different skill levels play against the computer, although it would be nice if the game allowed each player in a two-player game to select the style he preferred.  <P>When fielding, you can throw the ball one of two ways - by pushing the analog stick in the direction of the base and hitting the A button, or by simply pushing one of the four C buttons that represents the corresponding base. The latter is the more effective of the two since your player will sometimes take a few extra steps in the direction he's throwing the ball when you use the analog-stick method. Fielding a ball from the outfield is extremely easy, thanks to the guide arrows that always point toward the ball. Even when the ball rockets past your outfielder, and he's no longer on the screen, all you have to do is push in the direction of the guide arrows and he'll find his way right to the ball. Overall, the control in Griffey is easy and intuitive, both when you're in the field or up to bat, but it isn't perfect. When you're hustling to make a play, it seems to take too long for your fielder to throw the ball. This is due to the lengthy animation that turns him to face the right direction before he throws. While it looks nice, the animation could still have looked as good and fit the rest of the game's pace better if it just took less time to complete.   <P>Graphically, Slugfest is quite a step up from last years Griffey. It's no All-Star Baseball 2000, but the game does have that extremely sharp hi-res look to it, especially when you're using an expansion pak. The player models this year aren't nearly as boxy. Instead, they've got an extremely smooth look. The animation of the players is varied and well-done. <P>In the audio department, Slugfest is good, as far as baseball games go. It features play-by-play calls by Mariners announcer Dave Niehaus, as well as an umpire that at times sounds a little strange, a standard PA guy, and Ken Griffey himself making some color-commentary calls every once in a while. The sound effects are fair, except for one annoying sound, which occurs when you are throwing a special pitch - it sounds like an impression of a slide whistle. All this audio is presented in Dolby Surround, so those of you who have a good sound system will be able to take advantage of it. <P>In the end, Ken Griffey Jr.'s Slugfest, as the name implies, is a fast-paced arcade-style baseball game that will appeal to anyone who wants an intuitive, easy-to-play game. It's especially good for younger players who might not want to deal with some of the complex batting and pitching schemes of other N64 games. Fans who enjoy a sim-style baseball game should probably just stick to the option-laden All-Star Baseball 2000. --Ryan Mac Donald <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Superman, however, isn\'t one of them, and the game that follows is one of the weakest ever, even in the dubious category known as ""licensed games.""', 'The gameplay alternates between standard 3D adventure fare and timed mission objectives. The 3D adventure elements include collecting keys to open doors, beating up enemies, and pushing buttons in the proper order shortly after receiving instructions as to which order to push them. Meanwhile, the mission objectives require you to fly though hoops that Lex Luthor has inexplicably left suspended in the air, save innocents from harm, and toss objects about. Except for flying, to use your super powers you must acquire power-ups, such as heat vision, super breath, and super speed - all of which run out eventually.', ""Still, nothing sounds too offensive yet, right? It's the execution of all these elements that absolutely kills the game. The controls are so unresponsive that you'll assume you've pushed the wrong button and begin bashing on all of them for some sort of attention, and the perspective routinely manages to vex you. Now, add in all those simplistic goals mentioned earlier to this mix, and you've got an incredibly tedious experience in front of you. And it's one that resides in an environment so sparse it makes a Zen garden look crowded. This environment has suspect collision detection and obvious bugs that vie for your attention, and painted-in graphics that appear subpar even for a first generation N64 game."", ""But there's more. The multiplayer modes - a deathmatch and a race, where one player sets up the floating rings and the others attempt to push past him - feel very reminiscent of Ubi Soft's Buck Bumble, meaning they seem thrown in at the last minute and unfinished. The soundtrack would be considered bad for the SNES, and it loops constantly, while the sparse voice work even changes at one point, from Man of Steel actors to someone who sounds nothing like the lead of the show."", ""The only Superman compliment I can find to say is that flying beats walking. If I've been in any way unclear up to this point, let me state it simply: This is easily the worst game I've ever played. To steal a line outright from a film review in the San Francisco Bay Guardian, it serves no purpose other than to firmly establish the bottom of the barrel. --Joe Fielder <br />--<i>Copyright 1999 GameSpot Inc.

380,Lunar: Silver Star Story Complete,"['The standard 2 Disc Game Version by Working Designs, not the complete Box Set. Return to the world of LUNAR, in the completely reworked 32-bit version of the RPG classic. Journey back to a place where dragons yet live, and magic is valued above all else. Join Alex, the young adventurer, as he begins a quest with his friends to save their land from the crushing advance of the Magic Emperor. Explore dungeons, fight terrifying monsters, and gather information from the locals as you advance toward the explosive confrontation with the Magic Emperor himself! Exciting, menu-driven combat will keep you challenged until the last.', ""After a seemingly inexhaustible series of delays, Working Designs has finally redelivered the game that put them on the map. Originally released in Japan more than two years ago on the Sega Saturn, Lunar Complete is extremely dated but still delivers where it's important - gameplay. <P>Alex was but a boy in the isolated village of Burg, a boy who dreamed of one day being like his lifelong hero, Dragonmaster Dyne. As the typical RPG would have it, Alex's dream comes true as he's swept into an adventure to save the world from a great evil, save his woman, and enter manhood. While Lunar Complete retains the overall story and theme of the Sega CD original, a number of the game's individual events are different. For example, a number of the trivial problems facing Alex on the road to adventure, such as the broken bridge and lighthouse, have been eliminated completely, while the entire ending of the game has been reworked. Additionally, GameArts chose to add three new female accomplices to the ranks of evil. Fortunately, all these changes are for the better - the end result is an adventure that's more epic, satisfying, and generally cooler than the original while retaining the emphasis on character development that earned Lunar its lofty reputation in the first place. <P>Like the story, Lunar's gameplay has been tweaked and refined, but largely remains the same. Lunar is a traditional, old-school RPG in every way, even though it is one of exceptional quality. The excellent battle engine from the original is still in place. Unlike most RPGs, Lunar's battle system takes character movement into account, letting you position your characters and set up more elaborate attacks. Once characters earn multiple attacks through level advancement, this becomes especially useful. You will no longer encounter enemies in the overworld, however, and you can see approaching monsters in the dungeons. While the move to remove monsters from the overworld altogether is somewhat questionable, the ability to see monsters in the dungeons is a blessing, letting you run from or prepare for battles before they begin. On a more unfortunate note, Alex can no longer command magic and relies on virtually the same sword techniques that Lunar 2's Hiro does, ultimately hurting some of the game's strategic elements. As a result, boss battles generally boil down to Alex repeatedly using his Sword Dance until the battle's done, while the other characters support him with healing and attack magic. A minor flaw, and an unnecessary change, nonetheless. <P>As stated before, Lunar is a truly dated game - with the exceptions of the voice and FMV, the game portions of Lunar could be faithfully re-created on a Super Nintendo. However, the game's colorful graphics and visual design are still attractive, even seen through such a low-tech window - not a single polygon can be found on Lunar's dual CDs. The 2D simplicity of Lunar's world is greatly enhanced through the use of exquisitely produced anime cutscenes, used for everything from simple character introductions to brilliant destruction. Unfortunately, GameArts took away one of the Sega CD's coolest features, the lack of the RPG staple color-swapped enemies. Never in the Sega CD original did one see the same enemy, only sporting a different color scheme. Lunar: Complete not only brings pallette-swapping back in full force but mostly contains monsters from Lunar 2's bestiary. Lunar's sound is quite good, but much of the game's new music, such as the battle theme, doesn't compare with the original's. <P>Working Designs has had plenty of time to work on Lunar's translation, and fortunately it shows. The text is for the most part excellent and doesn't rely too heavily on Working Designs' traditionally puerile humor. The voices are also of excellent quality, truly bringing the characters to life in both the 2D world and the cutscenes. Working Designs' extras are nice touches, although the Making of Lunar video is ridiculously overwrought with tales of the game's translation instead of its creation. <P>So, it's finally here. Lunar: Complete is a must-buy for fans of the series, as well as an excellent introduction to this landmark RPG series. Lunar may not have modern aesthetics, but its gameplay and story are among the best of any RPG of any era. --Peter Bartholow <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

391,Hexen,"['Like New Condition! Cart Only. FAST & FREE SHIPPING! Reputation and Customer Satisfaction is Important to Us.', 'Since its PC inception, Hexen has gotten a bad rap: It\'s just not ""as good"" as its big brother, Doom. Its latest incarnation (this time on the Nintendo 64) proves that while in one way it doesn\'t deserve that rap, in another, it deserves it as much as ever. Yep, it\'s true, I have decidedly mixed feelings about this game. <P>For those of you unfamiliar with Hexen, it\'s an RPG-themed take on the first-person shooter. In fact, it\'s a sequel to a similar title called Heretic (a game known best for carrying the dubious title of ""the first Doom clone"") and both are based on the Doom engine, though they\'re happily altered slightly so that you can jump. Instead of playing as the perpetually furious marine, you are given the choice of three different character classes: warrior, cleric, or mage. Each class plays a little differently, with the warrior being stronger, faster, and lacking in magical attacks; the mage is weaker, though he has far-ranging magical attacks that allow him to keep his distance from enemies; and the cleric is a mix of the two. Artifacts have different effects for different characters as well. For example, the flechette item acts like a grenade for a warrior, a bomb for a mage, and, best yet, a poison gas cloud for the cleric, which can be used to take out multiple enemies if placed correctly. <P>Other than its characters, Hexen also differs from traditional Doom play by its ""hubs,"" or levels that must be come back to after puzzles are solved or items acquired. Both are pretty standard fare for players who have taken on other versions of the game (it is, granted, a fairly straight port), but if Hexen on the Nintendo 64 is the first time you\'ve tried the title, you\'ll likely find it a nice break from the monotonous ""run and shoot"" first-person games because of its puzzle aspects and more strategic take on fighting. And Hexen carries a play element that Midway\'s Doom 64 really should have had, the deathmatch. In it, you can take on your friends in two- to four-player matches. The four-player quarter screen match isn\'t really worth mentioning, but the two-player split-screen mode is worth your time. <P>Unfortunately, there are several technical factors that make Hexen a sub-par product when compared to Doom 64. The graphics, while better than ever before, are occasionally plagued by frame rate problems. Likewise, the sound is fairly moody and well done, but during save times, it freaks out and gets quite choppy. But most important of all is the title\'s fatal bug: During the platform jumping sections of the game, if you save on a platform before attempting a jump (which most players do), and then proceed to fall (this is bound to happen at least once), when you load your saved game back up, the cart places you in the middle of the fall instead of on the platform before you jump. Since only one save is allowed per memory pack, you can kiss any progress you\'ve made so far goodbye, making it impossible to play through. For me, this happened when I was about two hours into one game, and then four into another. Frustrating? Yup. <P>While Hexen on the N64 does have its plusses, I\'m afraid I can\'t recommend the title with this horrible save game bug in place. Many people were surprised when the game hit store shelves on time, but it looks like it wasn\'t really ready to go. --Joe Fielder <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Imbued with this new power, Specter gives Pipo Helmets to all the monkeys in the park and sets them loose, having them take over the local laboratory where the Professor and his assistant Natalie (Katie/Natsumi) are currently building a time machine. As Spike (Kakeru) and his best friend Jake (Buzz/Hiroki) arrive at the laboratory, they find themselves transported by Specter, along with all the other monkeys, to the various reaches of time.

Starshot and his unearthly friends explore seven nutty worlds in a bizarre galaxy far away where life is only for the strange. Players interact with over 300 comical characters. The action is set in a non-linear pace allowing Starshot the freedom to move freely throughout the zany environments. Be prepared for although Starshot has his mind set on what he must do players will never know the danger and pitfalls that lay ahead!', ""When it comes to enjoying a circus show, one has to take the good with the bad. Pluses: Human cannonballs, trapeze artists, and clowns. Minuses: Elephant poop, falling trapeze artists, and lions on the loose (well, maybe only at the poorly run shows). Given that logic, it's no surprise that the futuristic circus-themed Starshot follows this trend: For every thrill it offers in innovative gameplay, it stinks up the fun with graphics and control glitches."", ""In a nutshell, Starshot is a free-exploration 3D platformer in the same vein as Super Mario 64. The protagonists are the members of a circus troupe deep in debt and facing an evil rival - Virtua Circus, which aims to run all other circuses out of business. Starshot, a rambunctious juggler in the struggling troupe, is sent to visit various planets and find unique acts that'll make his circus profitable again. Each planet Starshot visits is essentially a huge level, with multiple missions to accomplish in each. Starshot comes equipped with the tools of most platform heroes: jump, shoot, and fly for limited periods. Along the way, he collects ammo, lives, flight fuel, and red bonus fuel. (He needs this fuel to travel to certain planets.)"", 'However, Starshot\'s gameplay is hardly cookie-cutter. Granted, there are plenty of standard jumping and bad-guy fighting sequences. But despite its kid-ike, cutesy graphics, this game\'s littered with surprisingly challenging puzzles. First off, not all enemies can be killed, so brute force isn\'t always the answer. In those cases, a player must usually lead one enemy to destroy other enemies - such as a shark to robots guarding a force field. The game also has puzzles that are almost like minigames, such as one in which you ""attract"" homing missiles so they hit living targets, or another where you kill forces on one side in a model wargame to get help from the other side to pass the level. The examples go on and on, and this game\'s rating benefits from this collection of puzzles.', 'As far as the storyline goes, this game gets a thumbs-up for its spunk and personality. All the characters seem to have smart mouths, which gives the game a rather offbeat, tongue-in-cheek feel to it - a refreshing change of pace from the always-on-Prozac characters found in other kiddy platformers.', ""Unfortunately, every 3D adventure title lives and dies by two factors: camera and control. While the game's level graphics are colorful and eye-pleasing (if a tad plain in some spots), the camera control often spoils the fun. Although no Nintendo 3D platformer has perfect camera control, Starshot seems subpar compared with other games in the genre. The camera especially wigs out in close quarters or walled-in areas. During some conversation sequences, the camera malfunctions as it follows what each character is saying. In cases when enemies are flying in from different angles, the camera can't pick up all the action, so the player is forced to take cheap hits. The game also has the nasty tendency to slow down or freeze in spots. You have the ability to move and zoom the camera on the fly, but it seems a poor consolation when you spend too much time adjusting the camera rather than playing."", ""Partly because of that camera control, jumping is a chore for Starshot, since many of the levels have instant fall-to-your-death spots. Although Starshot has unlimited lives, he's forced to start at the last checkpoint - which results in a lot of frustrating backtracking. The other problem with jumping is that it's very finicky. For example, Starshot can sometimes jump out of water near the shore, but in other instances, he can't - and it makes little sense why. Although players can get accustomed to Starshot's jumping quirks, it won't ever feel as natural or as fluid compared with other platformers."", ""As for extras, the game incorporates some nice ideas future titles should mimic, such as a level map that shows Starshot's location, where he must go next, and his current mission objective. Those who'd rather search on their own never need to look at the map, while those who are stuck can get a clue. The quest to find all the red bonus fuel also gives levels some exploration replay value."", 'The game\'s audio effects are decidedly average given the Nintendo 64\'s limits: All characters make the standard ""wah-wah"" droning sound as they speak, while the rest of the game\'s levels have OK music and effects that will neither disappoint nor amaze players.', ""Overall, folks who take Starshot for a trial run will fall into one of two camps. Patient, puzzle-oriented gamers will accept the game's camera and control flaws, and forge ahead just to experience the many gameplay innovations this game offers. Impatient, twitch-oriented gamers will complain it doesn't control as well as Mario or Banjo-Kazooie, then trash it after getting stuck on the first truly hard puzzle. If you're like this reviewer and fall into the former camp, then the circus-fun Starshot is worth checking out - just be prepared for a little elephant-scented doo-doo along the way. --Nelson Taruc <br />--<i>Copyright 1999 GameSpot Inc.

397,Command &amp; Conquer,"['The quintessential PC real-time strategy game <i>Command & Conquer</i>  has been re-created specifically for the N64 with new 3-D graphics and exclusive  missions not available anywhere else. Westwood Studios fully redesigned the game  for Nintendo 64 with new 3-D units, buildings, and terrain. Play as either the  lawful Global Defense Initiative determined to uphold freedom, or the evil  Brotherhood of Nod bent on total world domination. Construct bases, command  armies, and develop new technologies in a battle to control the earth.', 'Both the Global Defense Initiative and the Brotherhood of Nod have their own  characteristics and style of play. Each side has its own set of buildings,  units, and tactics of war. The GDI specializes in building barracks to house  infantry, while the Brotherhood of Nod is a structure that trains elite shock  troops. Throughout the game, players must seek out and mine the precious mineral  known as tiberium, which provides both sides with the power they need to keep  their forces operational.', 'There are a variety of mission types in <i>Command & Conquer</i>. Some require  an all-out assault on the opposition, while other missions demand careful  planning and strategy as only a single unit is available. Players must also deal  with changing terrain and the ever present ""fog of war,"" which prevents them  from viewing portions of the battlefield they have not yet explored. Support for  the N64 Expansion Pak allows for enhanced graphics.', '', ""Real-time strategy has been a staple of PC gaming for years. Several of the PC's most popular RTS games have made their way to various console systems, but all of them suffer from the same basic flaws: lower resolution and shoddy control. Command & Conquer for the N64 almost manages to get around both of these problems, and while the resulting game is good, there are still a few little clunky things that get in the player's way. The game's storyline, told through your mission briefings, is reasonably deep and pretty entertaining. While the full-motion video briefings of the other versions have been scrapped in favor of a slideshow of pertinent images, the audio is intact. So, depending on which faction you choose, you'll hear things from either a GDI (read: GI Joe-like good guys) or a Brotherhood of NOD (read: Cobra-esque bad guys) perspective. Each faction has its own worldview, its own various structures, and its own set of troops. Each faction does have different-looking vehicles and buildings, but do just about the same thing for their side. There are definitely differences, but the game is pretty balanced, so there really isn't any one super weapon on either force. Like just about every other RTS game in the world, this game is a tale of resource management. To build more structures and train enough troops to roll over your enemies, you must maintain a positive cash flow. You earn money by harvesting Tiberium - a mineral that rises to the planet's surface, forming dangerously toxic fields full of cash. Harvest enough of it, and you can build everything from basic machine-gun troopers to complex flying machines, flame tanks, and death-dealing obelisks. Come up short, and you can sell some buildings for quick influxes of cash, but this is usually a last-ditch tactic. Just make sure nothing happens to your harvester, and don't attack until you've got enough military might to crush your enemy two or three times, and you should be just fine. Those of you who have seen the other console versions of Command & Conquer are probably expecting this version to look the same as the other versions, complete with flat, blocky 2D sprites that are run in a resolution far too low to be discernable. But the terrain, buildings, and vehicles in the N64 version of C&C are done entirely in 3D, giving an all-new look to the game. This, combined with the expansion pack, lets you run in a higher resolution, which makes figuring out if you're looking at a minigunner or a grenadier a bit easier. If you still can't tell what you're looking at, the camera is slightly controllable, allowing you to zoom in or out a little bit. It would have been nice if the game ran at a resolution that would let you keep the map and building screen open at all times, since constant monitoring of your radar map is a key tactic in the game. Without the expansion pack, you're limited to the standard medium resolution. It looks nice, but it's a bit too blocky for my tastes. The game's speed and frame rate vary slightly throughout the game, depending on how much action you've got on the screen. At the beginning of a level, when you don't really have anything uncovered, scrolling is incredibly speedy, almost to the point of being too fast. When you get into major confrontations with the enemy, and structures are blowing up left and right, the frame rate sinks quite a bit, and the game's control suffers as the frame rate gets choppier. Aside from the frame rate problem, the game's control is well thought out and is definitely the best implementation of RTS-style control on a console controller to date. The C buttons are used to assign and recall various teams. So you can assign your attack force to the top C button, your engineers to left C, and so on. The analog stick lends itself well to controlling your pointer, though it's not quite as precise as a mouse on any of the control speed settings, so you'll occasionally miss moving targets until you've gotten used to the touchy feel of the cursor. The game features plenty of unit speech, and the music from the original version of the game has made it to the N64, though it doesn't sound quite as good. Keeping the audio from the PC version's briefings was a great idea, as text and still images wouldn't really convey the urgency of the game's various missions. Both campaigns from the original game are in this one, and there is a collection of pretty tough special ops missions that can be played separately from the main game. You can save your game at any time, though there are only two save game slots, so if you're the type of person that likes to save 20 different times to try different tactics, you'll be out of luck. The game doesn't feature any kind of multiplayer element, but considering that the only viable option would be a split-screen mode that would ruin any kind of surprise attack that you or your friends may plan, it's probably for the best that no time was wasted on a multiplayer mode. The single-player game is definitely strong enough to keep you interested, at least through both sides of the main campaign, though only hard-core players will remain onboard for the tough special ops missions. If you can handle clicking and dragging with the analog stick and the A button instead of a mouse, Command & Conquer is an improvement over the original game. The graphics give the game a surprisingly fresh look, and the excellent control scheme keeps the game from becoming as frustrating as the PlayStation and Saturn versions of C&C.<i>--Jeff Gerstmann</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

398,Evil Zone,"['Thadurca needs to be destroyed. But first you must defeat the 8 other warriors and your own clone. Only then can you face Thadurca. Some are fighting for revenge. Some for peace. Some for power. But right now... let the battle begin.', ""Originally released in Japan a few months ago as the tongue-twistingly titled Eretzvaju, Titus has picked up the projectile-based fighter and released it in the States as the hilariously named Evil Zone. An amalgamation of Psychic Force and Destrega, Evil Zone is a projectile-based 3D fighter that adds a dynamic element lacking from most of today's fighting games. Developed by Yuke's, the team behind the successful (in Japan at least) Toukon Retsuden series, and the not so successful Soukaigi (Square's recent action RPG), Evil Zone is a refreshing surprise from a development team not known for fighting games."", 'The premise in Evil Zone centers around the main character, Danvaizer, a superhero in the mold of classic Japanese afternoon TV shows (a la Power Rangers, Kamen Rider, etc.). While the storyline is truly superfluous, it nevertheless suffices as reason enough to gather Danvaizer and nine other combatants together to do battle in a distinctly different manner than most other fighting games.', ""Like Psychic Force, the majority of the action takes place via long-range attacks. Streamlining things considerably is the fact that there are only two action buttons at work: attack and block. While this may seem unfeasibly simple, the control scheme fits the game just fine. The attack button, when pressed once, twice, or three times, at a distance, will fire a basic projectile attack. When pressed within striking distance, your character will automatically use his close-quarters attack. The subtleties of the battle engine only reveal themselves at a distance, however, as the best and most powerful attacks are almost all long-range. By pressing the attack button in conjunction with the D-pad (up, down, left, or right), each character will perform different moves. Depending on how long you hold the attack button down, this will also affect the nature of the attack. For example, by pressing up and attack at the same time, one character might unleash an energy discuss. If you press up and the attack button rapidly two or three times, that same attack would now come out in two or three smaller, faster bursts. Also, each character has a stun attack (either forward and attack, or backwards and attack) that you can dizzy your opponent with, setting him up for a smash attack (forward, forward, attack), a projectile attack, or, better yet, a captured attack (down and attack). Captured attacks are particularly cool because each character has at least three different moves, depending on his proximity to the enemy (midrange, long distance, or behind). Should you snare your opponent with a captured attack, you'll be treated to some of the most visually spectacular moves yet seen in a fighting game. Take Danvaizer, for instance. One of his captured attacks holds his quarry suspended in midair as he summons the help of an orbiting satellite. The satellite then receives its digital commands and sends down a beam of light, through the clouds, like something out of Final Fantasy VII. The beam then strikes the hapless recipient in a screen-clearing explosion that does considerable damage. On top of the supercharged melee is the presence of the crystal attack. By holding down the attack button you'll fill up your life bar with a yellow streak. When your bar fills up you'll receive a crystal above your meter. You can store up to three crystals, which, when activated by your character's particular crystal attack, will essentially launch a supercapture move that involves highly damaging, highly humiliating attacks, that also differ depending on proximity. Above all, Evil Zone features some of the most innovative moves you've seen in a fighter."", ""Balancing the all-out offensive blitz is the block button. The block button will essentially neutralize almost any attack and must be used prominently, or else you'll find yourself facing the dirt in no time. Certain attacks, depending on their power, will chip away at your life bar like any decent attack would. In fact, the block button comes in especially handy when someone launches an up-close-and-personal crystal attack. The camera will switch to a dynamic close-up view of you swatting away your opponent's ferocious attack with blinding ease. It's awesome to watch this game in action. The other thing that aids you in attack avoidance is the ability to side step. By pressing up or down, you'll walk into or out of the foreground. Jump attacks only occur when the D-pad is used in conjunction with the attack button, so the 3D movement may take some adjusting to. In any case, it works very well and is actually useful for avoiding unwanted damage."", 'Feature-wise, Evil Zone is your typical game with typical features (training mode, survival, versus, story, options). The most interesting mode would have to be the story mode. In story mode, each character has his own between-game attract screens that give the game a lot more personality than your usual ""now loading"" screen. After you\'ve met certain requirements, additional bonuses unlock, such as an illustration gallery, music player, narrator selects, and an encyclopedia. Each character\'s own particular tale is told through still shots, engine-based cutscenes, and some uniformly hilarious voice acting. Instead of using subtitles with the original Japanese language, Titus opted to go all out and re-record everyone\'s dialogue. Too bad the dubbing is about as good as those old kung-fu movies of the \'70s and \'80s. Mouths continue to move after the character is done talking and the actors sound like rejects from a high school play. Interestingly enough, the instruction booklet is also victim to an incredibly poor translation.', ""Graphically, the game is a mixed bag that leans in favor of its pros as opposed to its cons. The characters themselves look great, with sumptuous light sourcing lathered over each unique fighter. The characters are also nicely detailed and look great even up close. Each of the fighter's special attacks is unique to the user; they look great and are amazingly inventive. Whenever you pull off a special attack, particularly a capture attack, the camera switches to multiple dynamic angles that give you a truly cinematic view - simply the best seat in the house at all times, and you never see the same attack from the same angle. Should you use only one supermove throughout the whole game, the autocamera will find a new way for you to view it each time. The downside is when you look at the backgrounds, which offer nothing in the way of geographical variances (like Destrega and its multitiered arenas). Instead, the settings are completely flat, with simple 2D bitmaps as backgrounds. Also, the backgrounds have a tendency to warp and look pretty weak as a result. Nevertheless, you'll soon forget about it once the fireworks start zipping around."", 'The soundtrack is nicely done, with each character having his own personal score, giving everyone a distinct feel. Sound effects are also well done and suit every effect in the game so you get a good sense of the action. Like Psychic Force, the introduction is hand-animated and is a nice touch to this extremely fun game. While the endings are really short and based around one generic theme, the game offers a lot of replay value, especially if you have a friend to play against.', ""While this game could have been an all-out offensive smorgasbord like the first Bloody Roar, it manages to balance itself well, despite only having two buttons to work with. That simple scheme works out well here. Despite the odd exclusion of now-common features like analog support and Dual Shock vibration, the control is top-notch with response times being right on the money. The characters look cool, if a touch derivative, but once you see the flowing hair and awesome special attacks, critics will soon find themselves at a loss for words. While it's not the greatest game of all time, Evil Zone is extremely fun and it shows that Yuke's has learned something from its past experiences. Although it's hard to make an impression in the fighting genre nowadays, Evil Zone (despite the horrible name and iffy voice acting) is a game that's definitely worth picking up. --James Mielke <br />--<i>Copyright 1999 GameSpot Inc.

399,Final Fantasy VII,"['Long recognized as role-playing games par excellence, the <i>Final  Fantasy</i> series gets a technological makeover in this installment (and series  debut on the PlayStation). Shedding the two-dimensional graphics and limited  sound capabilities of its predecessors, <i>Final Fantasy VII</i> features lush  3-D graphics, beautifully animated ""movie"" sequences, and soundtrack-quality  music. Coupled with the game\'s intricate storyline, endearing characters, and  immense yet highly imaginative world, these new advancements make for a quite an  engrossing experience.', 'The story of <i>Final Fantasy VII</i> centers around a solider named Cloud  Strife, who joins forces with Avalanche, a group of resistance fighters, to take  down an evil mega-corporation known as Shinra. (The fate of the world hangs in  the balance, of course.) Truly epic in scope, this four-disc game requires a  considerable amount of time to complete---this reviewer gladly gave up over 80  hours of his life to finish it. But it\'s definitely a rewarding adventure that  every PlayStation owner should consider undertaking, especially since it\'s now  one of the low-priced ""Greatest Hits"" titles. <i>--Joe Hon</i>', '<b>Pros:</b><br />', '<b>Cons:</b><br />', '', ""Never before have technology, playability, and narrative combined as well as in Final Fantasy VII. The culmination of Square Soft's monumental effort is a game that will enrich just as it will entertain. Yet, for all the boundless praise it so rightfully deserves, Final Fantasy VII is not without its shortcomings and occasional design problems. These are enough to make some gamers (who are unfamiliar with RPGs, to be sure) wonder just why anyone would bother playing through it in the first place."", ""This is the most dazzling visual experience to date on any console. Film-quality computer-generated cinematics blend seamlessly with pre-rendered background artwork to create the strikingly realistic world of Final Fantasy VII, both beautiful in its grandeur and terrifying in its detail. The overworld and battle sequences are presented in full polygonal splendor with just a touch of texture mapping for good measure. But you haven't seen anything until you witness some of the more powerful magic spells in the game. Massive dragons heed your bidding, dwarfing your gigantic enemies tenfold; an earth titan tears the ground up from beneath your enemies' feet, flinging them aside like toy blocks. Some of these summoning spells cut to over half a dozen different camera angles as the catastrophe unfolds. Meanwhile, a masterfully orchestrated soundtrack - courtesy of veteran composer Nobuo Uematsu - is a major force behind the intense emotion of Final Fantasy VII. The synthesized musical score hearkens Final Fantasy's golden age on the Super Nintendo, consciously staying true to its roots."", ""Yet for all its top-notch graphics and sound, truly the best aspect of Final Fantasy VII is the plot that these peerless aesthetics help weave. Join the enigmatic mercenary Cloud Strife in a journey that will take him to the very source of his being in an incredible quest where the fate of the world hangs by a precious thread, threatening at any instant to be torn by the charismatic, tormented villain of the story. Final Fantasy VII's moving plot is influenced by some of the greatest works of science fiction film and literature, including Frank Herbert's Dune, Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, and even Godzilla."", ""If you were to strip away the story, scenery, and musical score, Final Fantasy VII would otherwise be very much like any other Japanese RPG you've ever played. You still must face countless random monster encounters while keeping a close eye on your hit points and magic points, and you will witness your characters grow stronger with every experience level they attain. Battles are fought in typical Japanese RPG fashion (albeit with fully polygonal graphics), with your team on one side and any number of opponents on the other. You exchange blows until you or the enemy is defeated. Fights are made interesting with the introduction of Limit Breaks (devastating desperation attacks) and Materia, the curious colored crystals that let your party use magic and other special abilities. Materia can be found or purchased and mixed and matched to create all sorts of interesting effects. Best of all, there are more than enough hidden Materia, weapons, and optional plot sequences in the game to merit playing it through at least twice."", ""Some have gone as far as to call Final Fantasy VII the hands-down best game ever made. And if you enjoy a good Japanese-style RPG, chances are you will agree. However, Final Fantasy VII, for all its astonishing features, is not a game with the sort of mass appeal that its massive marketing blitz may lead you to believe. For one thing, you can't finish it in a sitting, as Final Fantasy VII will be a solid 40 to 50-hour commitment for the average role-playing gamer. Otherwise, you might be taken aback by the extensive, text-heavy dialogue; there is no speech at all in Final Fantasy VII, in the interest of letting your imagination do a little work. Though you will make many small-scale decisions over the course of the game, on the whole, the story follows a very linear path. This linearity is a by-product of the plot's complexity, however - certainly a respectable sacrifice."", 'Sony\'s translation of the original Japanese dialogue is direct and first-rate, much to the relief of Final Fantasy purists everywhere. Nitpickers may identify a very occasional spelling or grammar error (""Off course!"" agrees Cloud at the Golden Saucer battle arena), but otherwise this text-heavy game reads just right, flawlessly conveying each character\'s distinct personality. Even the foul-mouthed costars of the game retain their affronting attitudes, as Sony went as far as to translate certain four-letter words in the interest of staying true to the Japanese script. --Greg Kasavin <br />--<i>Copyright 1999 GameSpot Inc.

400,3 Xtreme,"['3 Extreme rocks your PlayStation with an all new 3D game engine featuring lifelike characters and panoramic 3D courses. 32 environments include narrow subways beautiful parks pristine coastlines slick riverbeds and tropical islands.', 'The Xtreme games have always been a mediocre racing series at best, but now, with the release of 3Xtreme, the series has hit an all-time low. The sprite-based graphics have been replaced with 3D polygons that actually manage to look worse than the sprites. Only six racers can race together, and the polygonal racers and environments don\'t look good. It still plays like the previous Xtreme games but you\'d still be better off with the original than you would with this.  <P>All of the familiar modes of play are still here. You can choose from three different types of ""extreme"" sports equipment: bikes, skates, and skateboards. Each of these can be used in any one of the game\'s four modes: season, exhibition, time trials, and freestyle. Two players can play exhibition, freestyle, and time trials simultaneously. The season mode is the main single-player mode. You race through a season composed of three circuits. The first has six races, the second eight, and the third ten. You and five other racers compete for the top three positions for season standing points. The better you do, the more points you have to spend on better equipment, which will, of course, help you win more races. By winning the circuits you also unlock extra competitors, courses, and equipment. There are 27 courses in all, with about 13 different racers to use. Each racer has his own unique abilities, which are shown on the select screen. Some are better at flat-out racing, while others are better at performing tricks.  3Xtreme\'s control scheme and overall play mechanic are terribly executed. The major problem, controlwise, is that the D-pad is used in conjunction with the shoulder buttons, making it super hard to come off a ramp or land at the angle you want. Most of the time you instinctively try to correct your racer\'s landing but end up making him perform a trick a foot above the ground. This trick setup causes nothing but frustration and pain. On top of that, the D-pad moves the character so slowly that you\'re almost always using the hard-turn button.    <P>Visually, 3Xtreme is a mess. The 3D models used for the characters are extremely blocky. The environments and objects also look bad. The frame rate is constantly going up and down, which actually makes the game hard to play. When you\'re lining up to go through a gate, the frame rate shoots up and your character moves too far to one side. The only neat visual thing in the game is the beautifully edited FMV intro video that shows some amazing tricks and crashes. <P>In the audio department, there are a few cool, fast-paced songs that get you pumped, but a lot of the sound effects are very weak. All you hear during the race is a bunch of oohs and ahhs from the racers, who are always slamming into something.  <P>In the end, there isn\'t one redeeming thing about 3Xtreme that would warrant buying the game. If you are a die-hard fan of the previous games and just have to know for yourself, do yourself a favor and rent the game first. After playing the game for 30 minutes you\'ll be wishing you had rented something else. --Ryan Mac Donald <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

401,Shadow Madness,"['Shadow Madness (Game Only, Playstation, 1999)', 'It\'s difficult to find a game genre these days that isn\'t inhabited with both Japanese- and American-developed games. For whatever reason, however, the console RPG has been a Japanese mainstay for as long as many can remember - most US-developed console RPGs were simply PC ports or adaptations, not original content. Let it be said that Craveyard isn\'t the US\'s best ambassador in the realm of RPG development, and let\'s hope it isn\'t the last. Considering how long this game was in development, one would have hoped that Craveyard would have come up with something better than this. Welcome to the land of Arkose, a typically fantastic RPG world that\'s recently been plagued by self-destructing cities, a mind-scrambling disease, and a variety of other social maladies. Narrowly avoiding death in the blast that destroyed his hometown, the roguish good-guy Stinger seeks revenge against the mysterious force that tore his life to shreds. On his journey, Stinger meets Windleaf - a waifish elfin girl with mystical powers, and Harv-5 - a literally barrel-chested farm robot. Shadow Madness\' story is fairly dark, although it has its fair share of humorous dialog and situations. The long, two CD-spanning adventure\'s story develops nicely, even if it is a little cliche or contrived at times. Due to the fact that it was written for American audiences, Shadow Madness\' text is of generally high quality and blends humor and drama with a mostly favorable effect. Supplementing the nice text is an abundance of Arkosian historical texts, simply available should players want to know more about the land they\'re saving. Chances are they won\'t, however, as getting to the story is a chore - Shadow Madness is a boring, poorly executed game, filled with an abundance of just plain stupid design flaws. The game\'s general look and feel are remarkably similar to that of the recent Final Fantasy games, sporting polygonal characters roaming around prerendered backdrops. Battles occur, as in many console RPGs, randomly. The key to any console RPG is a competent battle engine and interface, and Shadow Madness generally lacks both. Battles are built around a poorly conceived menu system that requires you to sort through four submenus with the left and right shoulder buttons. While this can speed access menu navigation with practice, it never becomes truly intuitive. As Shadow Madness mimics Final Fantasy\'s active battle system, the thinking behind this implementation is understood, but the execution ultimately fails. While boss battles are a different story, battles generally boil down to simply attacking monsters until they\'re dead, with little emphasis on the use of magic or other strategic devices. Random encounters generally require little strategy and take just a little too long to be tolerable. Fortunately, many random encounters can be avoided before they begin, but overusing this innovative feature can be detrimental to your long-term health and result in wasted hours of supplementary character building. Many of the game\'s other problems stem from an annoying lack of design economy, resulting in a game that can be summed up as sloppy. Arkose is a world littered with innumerable useless items - for every useful item you find, you\'ll likely find five completely worthless ones that you\'ll quickly discarded to make room for other useful items in the annoyingly small backpack. Inventory management like this is a complete waste of the your time, and Shadow Madness is rife with it. When you go up levels, spells are generally handed out in groups of three, resulting in an extremely long list of spells in a small battle window, wasting valuable time in the pseudo-real-time battles. To top it off, a majority of these spells have almost meaningless names and only slightly varied effects when cast. Innovations such as double-damage with a carefully timed button press. Avoiding random encounters are nice to see in Shadow Madness, but this hardly begin to make up for the game\'s problems. <P>Whoever said ""Graphics don\'t matter"" never played Shadow Madness. Shadow Madness is truly hideous to behold in its own right - even worse when compared with the RPG masterpieces it seeks to emulate. To start, the game features the most heinous character art in an RPG. Stinger is a, er... ""colorful"" caricature of FF7\'s Cloud, sporting a natty ponytail, a cute little red vest and a big sword. Harv-5 is a barrel adorned with a tin cappuccino cup, googly eyes, and a straw hat. And Windleaf... well, she just has to be seen to be believed. Other character designs include an old man\'s head atop a floating dinner plate, and a fat woman with cheesy cyberpunk-like sunglasses. As if their core concepts weren\'t terrible enough, Shadow Madness\' artists spared just about all efforts to bring them to life. Monsters and characters alike are decidedly low on polygons, textures, and animation. If the frame rate were decent, this kind of problem could be overlooked - maybe. The spell ""effects"" generally consist of expanding spheres with different textures, or sloppily rendered FMV summon sequences that look far less impressive than the real-time summon spells of Final Fantasy VII. Attempting to stray from the current trend of polygonal world maps, Shadow Madness instead uses a truly bleak, crayon-drawn series of 2D maps with no detail or visual appeal whatsoever. In what could have been a nice touch, Craveyard added character portraits to all dialog boxes - unfortunately, the crude, cartoonish nature of the portraits is as bad as the rest of the game\'s art and takes any impact from the accompanying text. The rendered backgrounds range from extremely drab to average, doing nothing to improve the overwhelmingly terrible visual experience that is Shadow Madness. To re-create an eyesore of this caliber would truly take effort. Surprisingly enough, amidst all of this, Shadow Madness somehow manages to pull an above-average musical score. Sporting a large variety of tunes for every situation, the music subtly and attractively evokes the game\'s darker nature and avoids the over-the-top orchestrations most RPGs tend to employ. <P>Shadow Madness is a decent story shrouded by years of bad decisions. As painful as it is to say so, seeing Craveyard disband after threats of a Shadow Madness sequel almost seems like a good thing. Shadow Madness is a curiosity and a cautionary tale of development for the ages, and should remain little more than that. --Peter Bartholow <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

402,Monaco Grand Prix,"['Innovative 4-point physics engine calculates and monitors all 4 tires independently creating the most precise simulation of Grand Prix style racing you will ever experience. 16 international courses. All tracks to scale with realistic dimensions scenery and environments. Cars modeled to Grand Prix specifications. Dial in track specific parameters for your suspension wing angles steering alignment brake balance & body height. Up to 22 racers competing on each track-Amateur Expert and Pro Modes-indestructible cars or real-life damage dents & shrapnel-With or without penalties-Weather effects & multiple road conditions.', 'As the person who put the Nintendo 64 version of Monaco Grand Prix through its paces, this reviewer wasn\'t expecting too much from the PlayStation port. All too often, games get ""watered down"" as they get translated from one system to another. Fortunately, that wasn\'t the case with Monaco Grand Prix. Whatever limitations the 32-bit system may have imposed on the developer, Ubi Soft has overcome them without sacrificing this game\'s strongest points: realism and graphics. <P>In terms of realism, Monaco Grand Prix provides 16 true-to-life tracks, each of which is rendered convincingly well. In addition to single race and time trial (the latter offers a ""ghost"" mode so you can race against your best lap), the game has arcade and full-season simulation. The arcade mode is reminiscent of Pole Position, in which racers must get to first place before time or laps run out. Since winning races unlocks additional tracks, it offers incentive to keep playing. <P>The game\'s main focus, however, is its championship simulation. This game succeeds thanks to a highly realistic physics system that effectively responds to car modifications (there are nine total, covering tires, gear boxes, and wing angles, just to name a few). Take for example a car that has too much understeer as it makes a turn. When you go back to the garage and make minute adjustments, you can see and feel the improvements when controlling the car in that same turn later on. <P>If that weren\'t enough, the physics engine makes car collisions more realistic and a bit more exciting as a result. In other games collisions are usually handled in a generic manner. In this game (aside from its arcade mode), collisions can vary depending on speed and impact. In some cases, a car will catch air and get up on two wheels. In other cases, a car will spin out. And unlike in some racing titles, skidding and spinning out isn\'t automatic once it begins. Imagine this reviewer\'s satisfaction at being caught in a skid, then correcting it halfway through and keeping control of the car without spinning out. This variety adds depth to the game\'s realism while forcing you to treat your car a lot nicer. Adding to that realism is an option to race between ten to 100 percent of an actual race\'s laps, depending on how much free time you have on your hands. Details like the ones mentioned above help boost this racing game\'s credentials. <P>The graphics also do not disappoint, mainly because of a smooth frame rate and decently rendered tracks. Although the PlayStation\'s limitations invariably force cases of background pop-up, they\'re hidden rather well by the game\'s designers. More importantly, at no point does the game slow down or get choppy, regardless of how many cars are onscreen. The decent graphics are augmented by nice details, including extras such as real-life ads, grass or sand coming off tires, and track marks showing the best line. Another plus in the graphics department is the game\'s many racing views that can be changed on the fly, including an in-cockpit view with a built-in dashboard. <P>As in the Nintendo 64 version, the computer AI tends to drive defensively. In the simulation mode, this works well. If you try silly moves on other drivers, chances are good that you\'ll spin out and wreck instead. However, in arcade races that AI profile works less effectively. You can just muscle your way through the field by outbreaking opponents or sometimes just by pushing other cars onto the grass. Although fun in a ""road rage"" sort of way, it dampens the skill level a bit. <P>If this game has one major flaw, it\'s that its interface lacks polish. While other titles in this genre have full commentary and in-game graphics comparable to television broadcasts, this game suffers with a clunky interface that looks imported from a first-generation racing title. The music isn\'t much to get fired up about either, although the game has a nice multiple-motor sound effect that\'s great to hear when a competitor\'s catching up. Finally, although there\'s a button that toggles a rear view, it doesn\'t work as well as having a smaller built-in rear-view inset - a feature other PlayStation titles have been able to incorporate. <P>Still, these shortcomings are a small price to pay for an otherwise solid title that is as good as - if not better than - anything else on the market in terms of pure racing simulation. Don\'t buy an F-1 title before first taking this game out for a spin. --Nelson Taruc <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

403,Need for Speed II,"[""Are you ready to pit your driving savvy against six international courses? Pick one of eight mean machines and let's go! Need for Speed II is fast and realistic with detailed 3D graphics and full-circle view. And when you think you're ready try the two-player split-screen mode for teeth-grinding competition!"", 'Need For Speed II is the first realistic street racing game on the PlayStation since the original Need For Speed. Unlike Test Drive: Off-Road and Tokyo Highway Battle (which were exaggerated), or NASCAR and Mario Andretti (which were true to life, yet never left the track), Need For Speed II focuses on realistic racing in populated settings...and the chaos that ensues.', 'While it\'s trite to say, ""If you\'ve ever wanted to get behind the wheel of a (insert expensive car name here), then you\'ll be itching to play Need For Speed II,"" it\'s also true. The game does feature eight supercars: the Ferrari F50, Lotus GT1, Jaguar XJ220, Ford GT90, Lotus Esprit V8, McLarren F1, Italdesign Cala, and the Isdera Commendatore 112I. But while each resembles its real-life counterpart in appearance, the simplified play control doesn\'t come close to capturing the feel of driving the actual car. The tracks do provide a thrill however, and if you\'ve ever wanted to barrel downhill through a small Greek village, your fantasies will be fulfilled. With five other tracks to race through (Canada, Norway, Australia, Northern Europe, and Nepal), the variety of exotic locales will keep you entertained long after you\'re sick of the supercars (no matter which of the fifteen available colors you paint them).', ""Like most driving games before it, Need For Speed II sticks to the basics: You select a manual or automatic transmission; your goal is to cross the finish line in the shortest amount of time possible; and there are buttons to accelerate and brake. The game also features power slides, burnouts, a rear view, replays, a two-player split-screen mode (accomplished with minimal slowdown), tournament mode, four varied camera angles, and the ability to drive in reverse - but most of these were available in the original Need For Speed or have been touched upon in other next generation driving games. A unique feature of note, but hardly a selling point, is the extensive information on the cars featured in the game. It's neat to look at but doesn't add much. There is also an undisclosed number of hidden cars and tracks, that is if you beat the game under a certain amount of time."", ""Once you're behind the wheel, Need For Speed II kicks into gear. The control, while loose at first, is quite accurate - expect to crash often, though, until you master it. Each level is challenging, taking an hour or so to familiarize yourself with and hours to master. But once you memorize the tight turns, there isn't much surprise left, aside from the hidden shortcuts in most levels. The most frustrating feature is the game's myriad crashes - pileups occur whenever you hit a car and you'll flip numerous times when you get too close to a wall at high speeds (no physical damage shows up on your car, but it takes you out of the race momentarily). Some courses will also try your patience; prepare to use your brakes often."", ""Need For Speed II looks really good. The 3-D texture-mapped graphics are on par with most N64 titles, although there is a significant amount of pop-up and the occasional backdrop looks flat or jagged. What is most impressive is that Electronic Arts has created a game on a 32-bit platform that, at least graphically, rivals the N64's Cruis'n USA. The sound is also quite good, featuring an electronic Euro-style soundtrack and realistic sound effects. In terms of presentation, the game scores big points."", ""Overall, Need For Speed II is the PlayStation's slickest racer yet, with its mix of realistic locales, superior graphics, and fast cars. It's more realistic than Ridge Racer and more of an arcade game than NASCAR Racing, and the combination should score with die-hard and casual genre fans alike. Simply put: Short of a Cannonball Run-esque plot, Need For Speed II has it all (although let's face it, who wouldn't like to see Dom DeLuise and Burt Reynolds in a driving game?). --Glenn Rubenstein <br />--<i>Copyright 1999 GameSpot Inc.

The game features 15 favorite MK characters plus the surprise reintroduction of several favorites.  There are more than 10 interactive fighting arenas, multiple game fight modes, several fatality methods for each character, a brand new weapon select screen, fully rendered intros and endings plus Dreamcast exclusive surprises.  Release currently scheduled for October 1999 (subject to change).', ""The Mortal Kombat series has been around for a pretty long time, and it's spawned lots of different spin-offs, including action figures, movies, and a TV show. We've even seen a spin-off game based solely on Sub-Zero. This ultra-violent fighting-game series has its share of fans, as well as its share of detractors. Regardless of your stance, Mortal Kombat Gold is sure to test even the biggest fan's faith in the line. <P>It's not that MK Gold is a bad game or anything. It's an outstandingly accurate translation of Mortal Kombat 4, with a few new characters thrown in for good measure. But the new characters don't really bring anything stellar to the lineup, and you're left with a game that you were finished playing around with back when it came out on the N64 and the PlayStation more than a year ago. <P>The game really does come across as a perfect port of the arcade game, though it also has all the extras the other console versions have, like the Ice Pit level and Goro, as well as the rendered FMV endings that had been featured on the PlayStation. Load times are next to nothing, and the graphics and sound are on par with the arcade version. Even though it's a perfect port of the arcade version, the graphics look pretty dated, especially when compared with some of the other Dreamcast launch titles. <P>The Dreamcast-specific features include the presence of some older MK characters, namely Cyrax, Mileena, Kitana, Baraka, and Kung Lao. All of them retain their older moves, though Kung Lao's hat toss is no longer controllable, and the moves for Cyrax's bombs are done slightly differently. Also, the 3D nature of this Mortal Kombat renders Cyrax's bombs nearly useless, since you can simply sidestep them and escape their blast. With the new characters come new endings, and like the other endings, they aren't anything special. The characters in the new endings have strangely elongated necks, and their heads seem to bobble around like those weird baseball figurines. <P>The game's AI is vintage Mortal Kombat, so it's chock-full of the same stimulus-response style that forces you to rely on the same cheap tactics to defeat the computer opponents. There's also a weapon-select menu on the character-select screen that lets you choose which weapon you want to take into battle, but between two skilled competitors, the weapons won't come into play very often. The game's generic combo system ensures that anyone picking up the game will be able to pull off three or four hit combos almost immediately. It also ensures that unless you're a huge Mortal Kombat fan, you'll get tired of the game pretty quickly. The Dreamcast controller does a decent job here, but some of the fatalities require you to hit multiple buttons, which can be a pretty finger-twisting feat on the gamepad. <P>Sitting down and playing MK Gold almost feels like a retrogaming experience - you really feel as though you've pulled out some old game that you haven't played in years - and it hasn't aged gracefully. If you're still interested in Mortal Kombat 4, then MK Gold should provide some sort of thrill. But the rest of the MK fans that have already moved on to bigger and better things will just have to wait patiently for Mortal Kombat 5. --Jeff Gerstmann <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

The warriors include men, women, and creatures from all over the globe and from various mythologies. Each is brought to life with amazing motion-capture animation, which results in incredibly lifelike and realistic duels. If you own a Dreamcast or are thinking of buying one, do yourself a favor and add <i>Soul Calibur</i> to your collection. <i>--Mike Ryan</i>', '<b>Pros:</b> <ul> <li>Exceptionally lifelike graphics and animation</li> <li>Multiple game modes--1-player, 2-player, team, computer vs. computer, martial arts demo, and more</li> <li>Secrets and extra features will keep players coming back</li> </ul> <b>Cons:</b> <ul> <li>May be too violent for some parents</li> </ul>', 'Let\'s get one thing out of the way: Soul Calibur is the best 3D fighting game ever released in the arcades. Better than Virtua Fighter 3. Better than Tekken 3. If that weren\'t enough, the Dreamcast version one-ups the original arcade release in just about every way imaginable. Now that we\'ve established that, let\'s explore why, and what it is about the Dreamcast version that raises the bar on fighting games in general. <P>From its debut at the 1998 Electronics Entertainment Expo, tucked away in a remote corner of Namco\'s booth, it was obvious that Soul Calibur was something special. Namco had pushed the PlayStation-based System 12 hardware farther than anyone had a right to expect from such a modest chipset. Namco took what it had learned from Tekken 3 and built on the ambitious, but limited, Soul Edge fighting engine. Soul Calibur was not only a substantial leap in graphics, but in gameplay as well. Employing a new eight-way directional system in conjunction with a physics engine that took weapon weight into account, Soul Calibur\'s gameplay reached new heights in both complexity and depth. Perhaps one of the most crucial additions was the inclusion of the tech-roll found in Tekken 3. No more lying on the ground as your opponent rained down attacks from the sky. Just a quick tap of the guard button and you were back on your feet, quick as a whistle. Graphically, the game was a fireworks display of particle effects, complex polygonal character models, and a light-sourcing tour de force, all running at a blazing 60 frames-per-second. <P>The short of it is, if you haven\'t played Soul Calibur, you need to. For sheer adrenaline working in tandem with eye-melting graphics, nothing could touch it. What then, does the Dreamcast version (Namco\'s first ""real"" game developed for archrival Sega in ages) of Soul Calibur do to leapfrog past its arcade counterpart in every way possible? <P>To begin with, the most obvious enhancement are the graphics. Despite the lack of a prerendered FMV intro, the likes of which we\'re used to seeing from Namco, the opening offered here will drop more jaws than Muhammed Ali. Think of the intros usually seen in Capcom games like Marvel vs. Capcom, but rendered in full, hi-res, 60fps 3D (with a splash of Samurai Shodown thrown in for good measure), and you\'re not even close to imagining how awesome the intro to Soul Calibur for the DC looks. Picture a first-person camera zooming in over some sandy horizon, as weapons slam into the foreground. Keep going until the weapons are replaced by a swiftly approaching Kilik (the staff user in SC). Trigger an impressive sequence of character cameos and a dynamic soundtrack, and there you have it. This has to be seen in person to appreciate. It looks so good it might as well be CG, because five years ago, graphics like these were impossible. <P>The reason the arcade version couldn\'t be ported home to the PlayStation was due to hardware limitations. Despite the fine conversion of Tekken 3 to the PlayStation, Soul Calibur on System-12 used an extremely high amount of RAM to enable effects like Z-buffering and other processor-taxing effects - effects that were not present in Tekken 3. The Dreamcast, on the other hand, represented the perfect solution to Namco\'s problems. With hardware roughly ten times as powerful as the PlayStation, the DC can not only manage Soul Calibur\'s graphic fireworks, but also enhance them by leaps and bounds. With characters boasting not only improved polygon counts, but high-resolution textures, each member of Soul Calibur moves around each stage looking larger, tougher, more solid, and more detailed than ever before. For example, Astaroth\'s alternate costume sprouts Godzilla-like spikes out of his back (these spikes wobble as he moves), along with a tall Alfalfa-esque hairdo that swings and sways depending on what direction he\'s moving in. Soul Edge alumni and Siegfried\'s alter ego, Nightmare, wields the Soul Edge itself, with an eyeball set in the center that looks around at the proceedings independently of the sword. Details like hair, clothing, and accessories all move in rhythm with an extremely realistic physics model. Improving the quality of the characters wasn\'t enough for Namco\'s programmers though. They also added a muscle-flexing system that causes pectorals to ripple during victory poses, breasts and buttocks to jiggle realistically (read: subtle, not exaggerated as in Dead or Alive), and skin to stretch in a most natural way, with not a polygon tear in sight. These characters look incredible, and some benefit from the enhancements more than others (Lizardman\'s tail no longer looks like a polygonal mess). Everything looks perfectly smooth (especially faces), with minimal blockiness, putting the models in VF3tb to shame. This is an extremely solid-looking game. The characters have also been outfitted with an extensive set of facial expressions that add greatly to the game experience. Take Mitsurugi, for example. With every sword slash accompanied by a grunt or yell, his face synchronizes the appropriate expression as well. Even during win poses, each character mouths his own victory speech. Even little things like fingers are individually rendered. <P>Weapons are also impressive enough to simply sit back and watch: The blades on Voldo\'s twin katars move independently; Kilik\'s bo flexes with each swing; and metallic weapons like Mitsurugi\'s sword feature specular highlighting (think Gran Turismo, but better) that reflects the environment around it. Other things, like head tracking, dust clouds kicked up by the characters\' feet, and amazing real-time shadows (check out Ivy\'s flaccid whip-sword in practice mode for a good idea of how cool simple shadows can be), round out the visual impact. Soul Calibur is so detail-intensive that even your character\'s breath can be seen on some stages. --James Mielke <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

While Armada does have a natural visual disadvantage of taking place in the void of space, locations such as planets are well modeled and well detailed. Armada's music is light orchestral-sounding background music that does a good job of making the game sound epic and spacey. While the sound effects are pretty repetitive and possibly mixed too high, they do their job well. Additionally, conversations in the game are handled well through digitized speech.

The popular <i>Street Fighter</i> series continues with a  multitude of new moves, specials, and super combos.', 'Street Fighter Alpha 3 on the PlayStation was a great translation, and the extra modes really brought a lot to the game. The Dreamcast version of Alpha 3 keeps all the great modes and additions from the PlayStation version but also uses the more powerful hardware to its benefit, delivering larger character sizes, sharper and more colorful graphics, and extremely minimal load times. <P>With Street Fighter 3 shooting off into an entirely new world with lots of new characters and Capcom\'s versus series of fighters pitting the Street Fighters against various comic book characters, the Alpha series is really the only ""classic"" Street Fighter line left. That\'s not to say that it\'s grown stagnant. Even though it\'s chock-full of characters that we\'ve been extremely familiar with for close to a decade, the little touches here and there and the addition of new fighters keep the game fresh enough to maintain its relevancy. <P>Moving on from Street Fighter Alpha 2, Alpha 3 maintains the same gameplay, though a few new options bring a lot of variety to the game. After you select your character, you\'re given a choice of three different fighting styles, termed ""isms,"" which govern the way your super combos work. A-ism gives you multiple super combos that can be executed at three different levels, much like the standard alpha combos in Alpha 1 and 2. V-ism gives you variable combos, which behave much like the custom combo feature introduced in Alpha 2. X-ism returns to Super Street Fighter II Turbo-style combos, where you only have one combo, but it\'s much more powerful than your average A-ism combo. There are also a few other subtle differences in the isms, such as the ability to air block. <P>World Tour mode brings a ton of single-player value to Alpha 3. The mode is basically set up a lot like Soul Blade\'s edge master mode. You travel from stage to stage, fighting in matches that have various requirements, such as time attacks, survival matches, and fights where only combos do damage. As you progress, you\'ll earn experience points and add-ons called ism-pluses, which grant you things like air blocking, charging super meters, and increased block meter damage. You can then import these world-tour fighters into the game\'s other modes, but they won\'t gain any experience in other portions of the game. Add to this little quick modes like survival and dramatic battle (which lets you play a three-player, two-on-one game), and you\'ve got enough modes to keep you busy whether you\'re playing alone or with friends. <P>Graphically, Street Fighter Alpha 3 has an outstanding look. The characters are large, colorful, and well animated. The backgrounds also look quite nice. The audio is about what you\'d expect from a Street Fighter game, making good use of stereo separation as the action travels from one side of the screen to the other. The music is also quite good. <P>The Dreamcast controller again proves that it isn\'t cut out for Street Fighter-style fighting games. Though not as bad an offender as Marvel vs. Capcom was, the controller\'s top buttons simply aren\'t as responsive as they need to be for this type of game. It may work well if you\'re driving a car, but trying to pull off Dragon Punches with them is a different story. Again, as with Marvel vs. Capcom, you\'re going to want to spend a little extra money and get Sega\'s arcade-style joystick, which solves every single problem posed by the DC\'s standard controller. <P>If you\'ve already purchased Alpha 3 on the PlayStation, that may very well be enough. But the Dreamcast version is a flawless conversion of the arcade game, with more options than its PlayStation counterpart. It\'d be worth an import if the domestic version wasn\'t scheduled to ship so soon.

Players actually feel the boats respond to waves, wild terrain and roadblocks with a realism unmatched in any other game.  Hydro Thunder includes ten vividly rendered tracks and 9 unique boats.  Each track contains short-cuts, ramps and turbo-boost icons that give players a burst of speed and invulnerability.  The incredible graphics are not to be believed and a split-screen mode allows head-to-head competitive play.  Afraid of the water?  Get over it.  Release is currently scheduled for 09/09/1999 (subject to change)."", 'When you think about racing games, you naturally think of wheels - be it two, four, six, or ten. The most memorable racing games have put you on some sort of road. Why is that? Perhaps air is too bland in its sheer openness, and water simply doesn\'t deliver insane jumps, tight corners, and clever tracks. Prepare to reevaluate that opinion, because the best boat-racing game to hit arcades has made its way to the Dreamcast - but what it hasn\'t done is brought anything new with it. <P>If you\'ve played the arcade version of Hydro Thunder, you already know everything about the game. So little has changed, in fact, that you\'ll wonder if Eurocom even made an attempt to do anything more than port the game\'s code to the Dreamcast. There\'s no intro, no new modes, no CG of any form - just the simple single-race-then-start-over play style that you\'d expect from an arcade game. It\'s almost as if Midway were satisfied with simply changing ""insert coin"" to ""press start"" and was done. This game has only two modes - play on your own, or play with a friend. There\'s no time trial, no tournament, no battle or practice mode, just the pay-per-race-styled ""game"" mode that you\'re already familiar with. And once you\'re actually in the game, there\'s not a whole lot you can do besides race. There\'s no difficulty control besides the actual track you pick; the mid-race pause menu has no options control; and the game doesn\'t even allow you to restart your race. You\'ll have to quit out to the title screen and choose your track and boat all over again. But what the user interface is lacking, Hydro Thunder more than makes up for in gameplay. <P>Boat-racing games have had little success because of the vast difference in physics from conventional street racers and the inability to replicate this difference accurately. Hydro Thunder breaks that trend and shows that boat racing is indeed a different dish. The engine was built entirely from the ground up, and it\'s clear that the team had spent plenty of time making the physics as real as they\'ve ever been in a boat game. Probably the most impressive aspect of the engine is that you can see your boat bounce in the wake created by another racer. These effects, combined with the realistic nature of the game engine easily make Hydro Thunder the best racing game to hit the water. <P>Speed is a racing game\'s most essential attribute, and Hydro Thunder has plenty of it. Even with tons of on-screen activity the frame rate is silky smooth, and pop-up simply doesn\'t exist. In the first-person view a breathtaking sense of speed is achieved, with only slight diminishment in the other views. The graphics are simply amazing. All the different flavors of boat racing are represented in Hydro Thunder - from catamarans to powerboats to nuclear-powered concept racers. And each boat not only has a distinctive hull shape, but it also has distinctive markings and flair. But that\'s just the beginning. The real eye candy is contained within the tracks. The track design is really innovative, and it takes advantage of the water setting. There are approximately three different types of water present in Hydro Thunder. The deep water comes in two types - calm or choppy, which are easily distinguishable by the excellent graphical effects. The third type of water is the calm shallows, from where you can see the river\'s bed, which is often littered with buried treasure, sunken ships, hungry sharks, or derelict aircraft. But easily what is most impressive about Hydro Thunder\'s graphics is how much you can see. All the tracks have hugely detailed backgrounds, and, as stated earlier, pop-up has taken an exit. <P>Not only does each boat have a distinct graphical look, it also sports its own engine effects. Some engines give the throaty growl of 16-cylinder gas guzzler, while others have more of a high-tech whine. The sound effects are done well, with good use of voice effects in the form of your aviator\'s private radio and the announcer. The music is all tense race-it-up-type music that makes it easy to use a lead foot. <P>If the Dreamcast controller excels at any genre, I\'d have to say it is racing. The analog buttons on each shoulder are easily the most comfortable and intuitive setup I\'ve used in a while, and it gives you better control than the arcade version did. The boost-jump is incredibly easy to use, and it helps you take full advantage of every track\'s secrets. The game\'s thirteen courses are full of huge falls, hidden areas, jumps, tunnels, shortcuts, and more. Want to tunnel through an ice cave? You can. Want to race under the docks of Venice? Do it. Feel like racing through King Tut\'s tomb? It\'s all you. <P>Unfortunately, the game\'s AI is a bit frustrating. It would seem that the computer-controlled opponents are faster depending on which boat you select. If you choose a faster, more difficult boat to control, you\'ll be up against faster opponents. This makes it a bit lopsided, as you get none of the pros but all the cons inherent in choosing a more difficult boat. So, in short, the best boats to select are the slowest ones, unless you\'re less concerned with winning the race than you are with placing the fastest time. Perhaps the most frustrating element of Hydro Thunder is the outright difficulty. You always start in fifteenth place, and the only way you can win a race is by hitting every boost, taking every shortcut, and hitting no walls. As if that weren\'t enough, Hydro Thunder retains the time gates - an arcade element. This makes finding shortcuts more accidental than intentional, as you\'ve no time to stop and explore the track. <P>Hydro Thunder was the best boat racing game to ever hit the arcade, and the Dreamcast version carries that tradition to the consoles. However, it suffers from a user-unfriendly interface and brings absolutely no extras home. Without a tournament mode, the game\'s replay value is hindered incredibly, and the lack of practice modes or time trials make the learning curve very steep. Hydro Thunder is a game I desperately wanted to like, but I was ultimately discouraged by the actual game because of the still-present arcade feel. At its core, Hydro Thunder is still a very exciting, edge-of-your-seat racer that offers awesome graphics and a solid engine, but in the end it almost punishes you for liking it. --Ben Stahl <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

422,Shadow Man,"['Send Evil back to Darkness. Live the nightmare. PS1.', 'When a publisher lists Sylvia Path as inspiration for a new game, as Acclaim does with Shadow Man, you know you\'re dealing with a different kind of game (or at least a different kind of development team). According to its creators, the third-person 3D adventure Shadow Man was inspired as much by poet Plath, and painters Bruegel and Bosch, as by Mario.  <P>But wintery New Englander Plath, for all her dark desolation, couldn\'t be farther from the Southern bayou, savage, exotic feel of voodoo New Orleans, where Shadow Man is set. Main character Mike LeRoi is an English lit graduate, and like many with such degrees, he has trouble finding work in his chosen field. He instead becomes a part-time hit man, spending his days sending men to the shadow world. His career is abruptly cut short, however, when he, along with his family, is killed in a car accident.  <P>Meanwhile, Mama Nettie, a powerful force in the New Orleans voodoo world, dreams of the Apocalypse. She sees five serial killers open portals between the world of the living - Liveside - and the world of the dead - Deadside. And the Five guide the damned souls through the portals, then use them to take over Liveside. <P>In terror, Mama Nettie creates the Mask of Shadows, resurrects LeRoi, and implants the mask in his chest, transforming him into the voodoo warrior Shadow Man, whose task is to prevent the early Apocalypse Mama Nettie envisioned.  <P>As Shadow Man, you load each hand up with one of 50 weapons, from the Shadowgun to the .50 Desert Eagle, enabling you to kill twice as quickly. Visibility in game environments is remarkable - you see well into the horizon, and the fog is far more for effect than cover-up. Iguana UK attributes this to its VISTA (Virtually Integrated Scenic TerrAin) engine, which takes advantage of binary space partition technology and essentially lets you see all the way to the horizon - without having to shroud anything in fog.  <P>And the seeing is a pleasure when the graphics are as good as these. The version of the game we saw was running on a high-end PC with a 3Dfx card, so the graphics on the Nintendo and PlayStation will obviously be different. But the graphics are incredibly lush - and creepy. <P>From the Asylum to the London Underground, you\'ll cross over from the world of the living to the world of the dead, both equally unnerving in completely different ways: Each Liveside location is home to one of the serial killers (like the Florida Everglades, the New York tenements), and each Deadside environment is filled with dead people and zombies. <P>Because you can use both hands, you\'ll have the advantage of being able to do two things at once, much like a real person can - you can fire your gun with one hand and pick up keys, unlock a door, or perform some similarly useful action with the other. Or, as Guy Miller, project manager for Shadow Man, points out, you can do all kinds of things like ""Killing, with two guns. Killing, with one gun and a voodoo weapon. Killing, with a gun in one hand and a flashlight in the other. Killing, with a gun in one hand as you pull yourself up a cliff face with the other hand. Killing, with a voodoo weapon in one hand as you hang with the other hand from a rope suspended above a chasm.... The killing permutations of the player-character\'s ambidexterity are pretty much endless."" <P>Shadow Man is a third-person adventure and bears the inevitable comparison to Tomb Raider. There is some similarity in play, but bringing that up seems to irk Miller. ""Tomb Raider is fundamentally linear, fundamentally a flick-a-switch shooter, fundamentally annoying in that each jump you make must be pixel-perfect, and you get punished for not making that pixel-perfect jump. Shadow Man is nonlinear, is not merely a flick-a-switch shooter, will not punish you with pixel-perfect jumps, and has locational gameplay, inasmuch as the environments will dictate the type of gameplay."" Gameplay, he argues, is instead a combination of Marioesque platform/puzzle-solving (about 50 percent) and bloody gore fests (50 percent). <P>Also, Iguana UK has designed Shadow Man as a more nonlinear game. You still have certain tasks that must be accomplished before others are even attempted, but you\'ll also play through sections where the levels can be completed in any order you choose, and some backtracking and zigzagging through levels is required in order to complete the game. But whichever path you choose through the game, all routes lead to a single end. ""There\'s a mystery at the heart of the game,"" Miller says, ""the answer to which\'ll blow your mind and make you wonder if you\'re really playing a game at all.""

This is evidenced by the impending deluge of Resident Evil/Biohazard spin-offs; Resident Evil: Code Veronica, Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, Oni-Musha (the RE-style samurai game), and now Dino Crisis. A brand new excursion into the world of survival-horror, Dino Crisis is a fresh experience that abandons that creepy Umbrella laboratory for a taste of Jurassic Park. Not only that, but Dino Crisis is unique in that it so closely borrows from the RE series. But in regards to the storyline, this game is not related to it Resident Evil at all. <P>Conceived and directed by Shinji Mikami, the mastermind behind the RE games, Dino Crisis will be very familiar to anyone who\'s played the Resident Evil games. The dramatic camera perspectives, the control scheme, and the eerie settings are all classic Mikami. However, instead of slow-moving zombies shuffling after you like drunks staggering home, you\'re faced with velociraptors and other big lizards with lightning-fast reflexes and huge appetites. <P>""This isn\'t a joke, you idiot! We were just attacked by a big-ass lizard!"" says Dino Crisis femme-fatale, Regina, to her computer-expert cohort, Rick, who, at the time, is trying to unlock electronically secured doors throughout the base where you\'ve been searching for the missing Dr. Kirk. Your other teammate, Gail, is missing, and the last you heard from him were some aborted screams and the sound of gunfire. <P>As you might now know, the backgrounds in Dino Crisis are fully polygonal as opposed to prerendered CG stills, like they are in Resident Evil. Perhaps it took Capcom all this time to get up to speed with the PlayStation hardware, but this makes all the difference in the world. Despite being completely 3D, the game still moves at the same speed as its brethren, without any slowdown. The game\'s graphics are also very sharp and appear to be running in a medium to high resolution. The character models are very well done, with excellent light-sourcing effects, giving Regina and her posse a very solid feel. The use of polygonal backgrounds enhances the feeling of fear even more than Resident Evil. For example, when you\'re walking down a hallway, viewed from a typical RE-ish perspective, it becomes even more tense when the camera angle suddenly pivots to an overhead perspective or swings to a worm\'s-eye view. The engine also allows for shifting camera positions rendered on the fly, keeping Dino Crisis moving along at a quicker tempo than Resident Evil\'s. Thankfully, the camera, with all its flexibility, is not abused or overused by any means. It is used sparingly, and only to enhance rather than to distract. <P>Since the game is completely 3D, it is not as easy to pick out necessary clues as it had been in Resident Evil because everything looks uniform. In Resident Evil you\'d be able to tell what to look out for since the polygonal details would stick out from the prerendered backgrounds. In Dino Crisis, you must really be on the lookout for anything and everything. The camera angles are vintage RE, designed to provide the maximum tension possible. If that weren\'t enough, the soundtrack is designed to provide chills and thrills as well. The simple act of walking down a hallway becomes a terrifying exercise in fear when the violins start playing. If you\'re not too chicken, this game is best played in the dark with the volume up. <P>As previously stated, the controls in Dino Crisis are virtually identical to Resident Evil\'s, with a couple of crucial enhancements. Since the basic control configuration works well enough, potential problems arise since velociraptors are a lot quicker and savvier than RE\'s zombies. As a result, adjustments to the combat system were necessary to avoid an unwanted Regina-burger. When you press the R2 button, your character does a 180-degree turnabout, allowing you to put some space between you and your pursuer before turning around and filling your opponent with lead. The second enhancement is the ability to walk with your gun held out, primed to fire. While you walk slower with your gun outstretched, it sure beats making a sitting duck of yourself each time you want to fire your weapon. With all this meat-eating terror stalking the hallways (and windows and air-vents, etc.) it would get annoying to have to manage the ribbon-saving system found in Resident Evil. Instead, Dino Crisis features save rooms that prompt you to record your data whenever you attempt to leave or pass through one of these rooms. The number of times you save (or continue, should you die) affects your final score/rating and should be used sparingly.  <P>The details in Dino Crisis are excellent too. If she takes a little damage, Regina will hold her side, limping a bit. If she takes a lot of damage, she\'ll be absolutely stagger around. She\'ll also drip blood on the floor, adding to the realism in Dino Crisis. Fortunately, there are plenty of power-ups (health kits, weapons, etc.), and an accessory-customization system similar to the one in Parasite Eve. Other things like head tracking, and auto-aiming sort out any additional combat-oriented complaints from the RE series as well. Interestingly, analog support does not seem to be featured, although the Dual Shock action is intact. Loading times between rooms are also severely reduced, due to the polygonal environments that take less space to store in memory.  <P>So, from the looks of things, it appears as if Capcom has another winner on its hands. Dino Crisis is less disturbing than the RE series, but possibly more frightening since each of the creatures in DC hold about the same shock value as the Dobermans did in Resident Evil. While cannibalizing its own library could have backfired with a ""been there, done that"" aftertaste, Dino Crisis walks away under the strength of its own merits. The control improvements and graphic reinvention make DC its own game, with little owed to Resident Evil. The storyline is sound, and the replay value is high, with three different endings to reveal and a multitude of secrets to find (multiple costumes, a timed dinosaur hunt, mini Regina and giant Regina, etc.). With Oni-Musha, Nemesis, and Code Veronica on the horizon, Capcom might have this genre all to itself. While games like Carrier, Blue Stinger, and Alone In the Dark 4 will try and crowd the limelight with similar offerings, for the time being, it looks as if Capcom is king of the survival-horror hill. --James Mielke <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

425,Pac-Man World,"['Includes case and instructions. Great shape!', 'It\'s been two and a half years since Pac-Man World first popped its head up at the 1997 E3 in Atlanta. At the time, it looked like an attempt by the American development team to ""pull a Mario"" on its legendary mascot. Even two years ago, the game didn\'t really look all that great, and as a result, the original development team was pulled and, after much hemming and hawing, work resumed on the project.  <P>It has now been 20 years since the ""little yellow dot that could"" emerged on the video-game map, and much has happened since then. Gameplay mechanics can no longer rely on such simple control schemes, and Namco has had its hands full trying to inaugurate its armless/legless character into the digital age. The good news is that whatever Namco has done to the pill popper known as Pac-Man, the current Pac-Man World has turned out great. Staying true to the format, it is a title full of charm, ingenuity, and playability. <P>While this is no Mario 64 or Sonic Adventure, Pac-Man World could at least be described as Klonoa-lite. It seems as if Pac-Man\'s mortal enemy, Toc-Man, has kidnapped Ms. Pac Man, Pac Jr., Baby Pac, Professor Pac, Pooka (from Dig-Dug) and Chomp Chomp the dog-pac. (Tupac was, apparently, nowhere to be found.) Naturally, it is up to Pac-Man to find and rescue his friends from Toc-Man\'s hiding spots, which include desert islands, deep-space outposts, and mine shafts. While not in possession of the vast array of moves that his bunny-like counterpart possesses, Pac-Man has learned a few things along the way. As befits any mascot worth his salt, a butt-bounce has been implemented to take care of opening chests and dispatching enemies of a nonghostly nature. He also has a power shot (which uses energy) an ultra-butt-bounce, and, of course, the power pellet, which he will use to chomp on Inky, Blinky, Pinky, and Clyde.  <P>Throughout the game, there is a large number of puzzles for you to find; you use the ol\' ""find the key, open the door"" techniques to achieve your goal. Along the way, you will encounter enemies to vanquish, b-doing platforms to launch yourself to spots too high to reach with a normal jump. You must find buttons and jump on them to open doors that may hold the keys you\'ll need to open other doors. Pac-Man also has a spin-roll move he can use to zip up hills he cannot climb, and a rev-run that generates power to propeller-platforms scattered around the game. While some aspects of Pac-Man World could be viewed as derivative, there are definitely moments that Pac-Man can call his own. While this may seem fairly standard, and it is, the game is very well designed, and the graphics are rich and convincing. The backgrounds look like a cross between Klonoa\'s and Crash Bandicoot\'s, which is a very good thing. In addition to that, Pac-Man himself has a large variety of facial expressions, making him practically irresistible. He has facial expressions for every activity - swimming, walking, running, or just standing around. He is very well animated (for a round yellow man-thing, that is) and the control is top-notch. The challenges in the game boast a fair and gradual learning curve. Should you find certain Galaxian doors, you will be transported to bonus levels that are 3D versions of old-school Pac-Man maps, where you eat dots and try to chomp the ghosts. As you discover these secret levels, you will unlock them in the puzzle-mode, which features more than 30 mazes. The original Pac-Man game - just like the kind found in the Namco Museum games - is included in its entirety, as well. Between these two options and the twenty-plus levels in the platforming game, there is more replay value here than one might have expected from a game of such humble origins.  <P>With all the crappy ""Xtreme"" sports games flooding the market, along with uninspired first-person shooters, racing games, and rip-off platformers, it\'s encouraging to see one of the originators come back in style. While the simple gameplay and cutesy premise may turn off some so-called ""hard-core gamers,"" anyone with an open mind would do well to pick up the Pacster\'s newest offering. Basically an unpretentious offering that hold its own as a platformer, Pac-Man World is a fun little game that goes beyond mere regurgitation. This one is worthy of anyone\'s library. Don\'t call it a comeback. --James Mielke <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

426,NBA Showtime: NBA on NBC,"[""Midway is one of those third-party publishers that will put every game on every platform possible. As such, NBA Showtime, the company's latest arcade basketball game, is coming to the Dreamcast, the Nintendo 64, the PlayStation, and, yes, the Game Boy. The PlayStation version manages to feature most of the options and gameplay of the arcade version, but the sound and graphics have taken a rather large hit. NBA Showtime is essentially the latest iteration of the arcade basketball classic, NBA Jam. The most obvious upgrade from Jam to Showtime is graphical. The game is now in full 3D, as opposed to NBA Jam's 2D looks. The arcade version of Showtime featured extremely nice player models. The player heads looked outstanding. While the arcade version had players that looked real (to the point of being downright frightening at times), the PlayStation just can't push the required number of polygons to deliver that arcade look. As such, the characters look blocky, the crowd doesn't move, the ball leaves an ugly motion trail. But graphical tweaks have been made so that the game runs at a playable speed. Unlike Jam, Showtime actually calls fouls. After one human player (computer players are allowed to be as nasty as they want to be) commits five fouls in one quarter, a player from the opposing team is sent to the line for a free throw, worth three points. Now, at first, the concept of fouls in a no-rules arcade basketball game may seem like a horrible idea, but it actually balances the game out fairly well and keeps it from degenerating into huge shove fests. The game features a lot of speech, including the calling out of every player name. The gameplay is vintage NBA Jam. It's two-on-two basketball at its finest, complete with huge dunks, alley-oops, shoves, swats, and lots and lots of goaltending. The ball never goes out of bounds, and aside from goaltending and the occasional foul call, the only other rule is the shot clock. You've got a turbo button, a pass/steal button, and a shoot/jump button at your disposal. You'll control the same player throughout the game, so if you don't have a human teammate, you'll have to issue commands to your teammate when he's carrying the ball. You can call for a pass or command the computer player to shoot the ball. Double tapping turbo executes a quick evasive spin or dodge move that you can use to get past pesky defenders. The game features a create-a-player mode, which lets you pick a head for your player, as well as customize several stats, such as height, weight, dunking ability, and power. You can pick a jersey number and what name the announcer will call you by. As you win games with a created player, you'll earn new points to distribute in the various stat categories. Aside from the aforementioned gameplay bugs, the game controls reasonably well. You use the analog controller to simulate the arcade game's 49-way joysticks. Because the player models look a little funky, it's occasionally hard to tell which way you're pointed when all four players crowd together. This makes accurate shoves and steals tough. It's not perfect, but NBA Showtime is still a fun four-player game, and it's worlds better than any other arcade basketball game on the PlayStation. Give it a three-day rental and see if you're left hungry for more.<i>--Jeff Gerstmann</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

428,NFL Blitz 2000,"['NFL BLITZ 2000 is the updated version of the popular NFL BLITZ. All of the arcade-style football action has returned, including seven-on-seven play, bone-crunching hits, big plays, and no referees. However, there have been several gameplay improvements. There are more plays to choose from this year, but if none of them are acceptable, create your own with the Play Editor. And, changing plays at the line of scrimmage is a breeze with the new audible system. Wisely using audibles and playing well will result in your team being ""on fire,"" giving your players boosted abilities. Try these new abilities out on three of your friends in the Tournament mode, or challenge all of the teams in the league in the Arcade mode. If your goal is to win the Super Bowl, guide your team to victory in the Season mode. NFL BLITZ 2000 has action so intense; your mama will feel it.', ""When NFL Blitz came out for the PlayStation a little under a year ago, the game's sequel, NFL Blitz '99, was very close to hitting arcades. This resulted in a bit of a bind: Stay home and play the still-great two-player game or venture into arcades seeking four-player gaming, new plays, and all the other little tweaks and fixes that the second release brought? Now, a year later, Midway is finally bringing the Blitz series up to speed on the consoles. But NFL Blitz 2000 is far more than a mere port of Blitz '99."", ""For starters, the play editor that had been exclusive to the Nintendo 64 version of Blitz and the arcade version of Blitz '99 has come to the PlayStation, and it has been expanded. Now, instead of just being able to create a page of offensive plays, you can create defensive formations, as well. You can also make new fake punts and fake field-goal formations. The playbook section is also where you'll set your audibles, which let you change plays on the fly if you see an unfavorable setup on the other side of the field. Finally, you can edit your playbook's three pages of offensive plays and one page of defensive plays, picking from a wide variety of brand-new plays, as well as from all the old favorites from Blitz and Blitz '99."", 'The gameplay has also been changed a bit. Most of these changes just bring the gameplay up to date with Blitz \'99, but there have also been a couple of things added here. The most drastic change is the addition of four-player support. In the four-player game, one player controls the quarterback, his teammate takes on the role of receiver, and the other two players can play any defensive player they choose. The push move, which made you stand still in the original Blitz, has been changed to an on-the-fly push, which makes it a much more useful move, since you can use it and still keep running. The deep strategy that the two-player game had contained has been traded for faster four-player action in the form of push battles, where the human-controlled receiver tries to push down all his opposition to get open, while the opposing team tries to keep the receiver on the ground with the very same push move. Of course, the two-player option is still intact, as is the ability to play one- and three-player games. Three-player games can be tough, since having to deal with two human defenders is a real challenge. The ""on fire"" feature that was made popular in NBA Jam and which entered the Blitz series in \'99 remains in 2000. Much like Jam, being on fire in Blitz gives you infinite turbo and makes you much harder to stop. Unlike Blitz \'99, if you\'re on fire and you throw an interception, the fire goes out immediately after the interception, instead of waiting until the end of the play. New to 2000 is the kick meter, which gives you both distance and directional control over all your kicks. Extra point kicks are still handled with just a button press. In an attempt to appease players that are more accustomed to more conventional football games, an icon-based passing system has been included in the game, but it\'s totally optional. Personally, I feel it\'s poorly implemented, since while you\'re using the icon-based system, spinning and jumping to evade sacks are a bit more difficult. The game\'s rosters are also up-to-date.', ""The original PlayStation Blitz looked good for a PlayStation game, and Blitz 2000 holds true to that standard, making some pretty substantial improvements. The palette is much better this time around, resulting in more-colorful players and fields. Also, the game moves a bit quicker and much more smoothly. The sound has also been fixed up a bit. The commentary is timelier, and several phrases have been added to the announcer's vocabulary."", ""People who haven't seen Blitz '99 in arcades yet are going to be blown away by the additions and tweaks that have been made since the original Blitz was released on the PlayStation. Veterans of Blitz '99 will welcome the ability to finally play the updated game at home, and the new Y2K add-ons don't hurt, either. NFL Blitz 2000 still has a firm lock on the arcade football business. --Jeff Gerstmann <br />--<i>Copyright 1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

431,Trick'n Snowboarder,"[""Trick N' Snowboarder (Game Only, Playstation, 1999)"", 'Apparently, some Y2K consultant has made a mint by advising video-game companies that the only way to survive the new millennium... is to make a snowboarding game. How else can anyone explain why every game maker (and its respective mother) has flooded the market with variants on this extreme sport? <P>Whether the video-game market needs more snowboarding titles is up for debate. Regardless, Capcom has joined the fray with Trick\'n Snowboarder, an arcade-style speed-and-tricks reflex tester that\'s high on playability - if low on originality. Although pessimists may accuse Capcom of milking the proverbial ""cash cow,"" there\'s no denying that Trick\'n Snowboarder looks flashy, plays smooth, and makes for an engaging - if a bit too easy - alpine experience. <P>The game sticks to the standard recipe for snowboarding titles: wild downhill courses with tons of jump-off points and occasional obstacles; different modes such as alpine, half-pipe, and single-jump competitions; and marginal extras like replay saves and player/title logo-edit functions. <P>The game\'s main strengths are its well-designed tracks and gameplay flexibility - especially for two-player vs. matches. TNS starts with 14 tracks set in locations from Russia to Italy, each well rendered and providing neat little graphical details (the best: a dog chasing after a boarder in the Japan level). The two-player mode augments those tracks with a wealth of options. Notably, you can compete on horizontal or vertical split screens or via link cable. Plus, you can compete for most trick points, race for speed, or do a combination of both. This customization works smoothly and makes for an easy-to-use ""party"" game. <P>For single players, the game has a scenario mode that walks you through a bare-bones storyline with trick requirements for each level. Between levels, secret characters pop up for extra vs. player battles, which spices things up a bit. Beating the scenario mode unlocks additional secret players, which adds marginal playability to the game. <P>From a control standpoint, the game keeps things simple. While the top shift buttons turn the board left or right, three other buttons jump, grab the board, and flip the boarder while in midair. This makes for highly fluid control, making the game very easy to play while giving it an accurate feel. At no point does the gameplay feel mechanical, which is a great plus. <P>In terms of presentation, the game follows a slick MTV-style formula with surprising success. The gist of the gameplay is that the boarders are filming video of awesome tricks. The camera angles come from helicopters capturing your every move. The graphics hold up well under this setup, with the only glitches being occasional polygon dropping in the foreground as boarders whiz past objects (this flaw is a bit more pronounced in the two-player mode). However, it\'s not enough to hamper gameplay, and more importantly, the frame rate never slows down. The well-integrated sound effects, mostly of the boarder on snow and the chatter from the helicopters ahead, add a bit of an adrenaline rush - although the extra noise may annoy some gamers. <P>Despite the praise for its gameplay and graphics, the game has one built-in flaw: Because it\'s so easy to play, it\'s also really simple to beat.  While this doesn\'t detract from the two-player mode, it makes the one-player scenario mode awfully easy to run through in one night. Although there\'s incentive to unlock additional hidden characters - including some of the cast members from Capcom\'s Resident Evil game - by beating this mode repeatedly with higher scores, the storyline remains unchanged, making it less appealing to play over and over again. While some may enjoy replaying these same levels to master new tricks, others might find the one-player experience too shallow to sustain their interest. Altered storylines for different characters would have improved that problem somewhat. Another minor flaw in the scenario mode is that you can\'t decide how to allocate skill points as a boarder improves between levels - the computer chooses. <P>So while Trick\'n Snowboarder may not pack enough original mojo to rise far above other well-known titles in its genre, it plays fast and looks good. Although it might be a bit on the shallow side for one-player action, it\'s great for two-player battles, thanks to a wide selection of courses and fluid gameplay. Overall, this title holds its own against competitors and should suit most casual snowboarding fans fine. --Nelson Taruc <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

But it's also just as likely that you've gotten the chance to take one out for a test drive, found how easily the little machine gets stuck under a desk or behind a doorway, and then, the glamour having faded, moved past the need to own one. That said, Acclaim has created a video-game version of R/C car racing that imitates reality all too well. <P>The cars in Re-Volt vary in three main factors: acceleration, top speed, and weight (front, rear, and 4-wheel drive are also options). Weight is the most important because the lighter the car, the more likely it'll flip over or spin around. So, the heavier the car, the more control you have. The physics are unforgiving, even on the basic setting; on simulation, they're hell. On arcade, they're reasonable, but still tough. <P>The gamut of power-ups gives the game a Mario Kart-like quality, so you'll constantly be diving for a new weapon with which to blast the lead cars. A nice variety of items is available, from oil slicks to homing bottle rockets, electro pulses that cut your opponent's power, and an item that turns your car into a bomb (yes, your antennae becomes a fuse), a fate you can avoid only by smacking into another car. <P>The graphics look sharp in areas close to the car, but in large open tracks, there's an appalling amount of pop-up. Meanwhile, the soundtrack is very solid with an array of clubby techno tunes. Beyond the expected tournament modes, there's also a stunt arena, a track editor, multiplayer races, and a multiplayer battle tag mode (essentially a game of tag). But while the multiplayer race keeps a decent frame rate, and the perspective provides a good view of your surroundings, the computer-controlled racers are missing as competition. Plus, the battle tag is silly, the stunt area is pretty worthless, and the track editor is as basic and clunky as it was in Jeremy McGrath Supercross '99. <P>The poor performance of most of the extras doesn't detract much from the game. The basic game elements do that just fine. There are just too many things to vex you in Re-Volt - from a basic corner turn that forces you to spin out completely to a leap off a curb that causes you to flip over, from sustaining constant enemy fire to getting stuck on a wall at the absolutely worst time.

This is a game that will at times tempt you to destroy both your controller and your TV. There are simply too many things that can and do go wrong, either in order or concurrently.

And for manager wannabes, there is a fun create-your-own-wrestler feature which lets you build and send your very own seven-foot , 450-pound giant dressed up in a black bikini out onto the mat.', 'Acclaim Sports has done a superb job with the graphics and running commentary, making the game extremely realistic and entertaining. Moreover, up to four people can get in on the action, whether they pair up in a tag team match or duke it out in a winner-take-all king of the ring extravaganza. Devout pro-wrestling fans will not be disappointed. <I>--Hugh Arnold</i>', '<b>Pros:</b> <ul> <li>Create your own ""pay-per-view"" event or wrestler</li> <li>Cool graphics and commentary</li> <li>Multiplayer option</li> </ul> <b>Cons:</b> <ul> <li>Steep learning curve</li> <li>Need a memory card to save newly created ""pay-per-view"" events, wrestlers, and careers</li> </ul>', 'The Nintendo 64 version of WWF War Zone differed a bit from its PlayStation counterpart. The sound wasn\'t nearly as good, but it contained one extra mode that the PlayStation couldn\'t handle. This time around, the games are virtually identical from a features standpoint. And the N64 version has the same music and speech as the PlayStation version. But the improved graphics definitely put this one over the top when you put the two versions side-by-side. Is this year\'s WWF game from Acclaim different enough from last year\'s? In the end, it all depends on how you look at the game. <P>The most obvious improvement to the game is the roster, which has been updated with the times to reflect the ever-changing faces of the World Wrestling Federation. That\'s not to say that the rosters are current, though. Much like War Zone, and well, most other licensed wrestling games, a few wrestlers have changed gimmicks since the game\'s development began. Of course, with development cycles as long as they are these days, you really can\'t fault Acclaim for this one bit. So the Headbangers are still in the game, as is Sable, and Triple H enters the ring to the original D-Generation X music, complete with X-shaped fireworks. <P>Speaking of ring entrances, they\'ve come a long, long way since War Zone. Now you get to see the full ring intro from the game engine\'s perspective, complete with the real, digitized music, from Steve Austin\'s slow swagger to the ring to Ken Shamrock punching himself in the head. Once the wrestlers have all made it to the ring, they\'ll each bust off a little non sequitur before the match starts, like ""DTA! Don\'t trust anyone!"" or Kane mumbling something through his little voice-box thing. It would have been nice to see some end-of-match taunts, similar to the beginning-of-match speech, but instead the winning wrestler stands in the middle of the ring and lamely goes through his taunt animation over and over again. It would have been even nicer to see a few short FMV clips in the game, or at least audio clips of the wrestlers talking trash about each other to various announcers. A rendered announce table at ringside to facilitate a little prematch commentary also would have added another level of depth to the game\'s already thick atmosphere. <P>But enough about all this extra atmosphere stuff. As much as an installment of Raw has very little to do with actual wrestling and more to do with storylines and atmosphere, the game still needs to deliver in the gameplay department. Attitude plays extremely well, but it also plays nearly identically to War Zone. The most significant change to the gameplay is the addition of a more robust set of reversals. In War Zone, most people stayed away from the tie-up position, instead raining on an opponent\'s parade with tons of moves from the ready position. But Attitude\'s got more reversals for moves that come from the ready position, so varied attacks are more important than ever. Regardless of that, however, the game remains largely the same, so those of you who didn\'t like the War Zone rock-paper-scissors-style tie-up system will still be out in the cold. The tie-up system is a great idea, and it keeps you honest by preventing you from doing the same move over and over again, but too frequently you\'ll be trying to do a move from the ready position as your opponent grapples you. You\'ll still be hitting the button for your ready move just as the grapple takes effect, and the result is a match filled with arm bars and other weak moves. Also, even though lots of wrestling games feature tag team or other multiplayer matches, no one seems to have come up with a good way to control all that action. The result in Attitude is a button that cycles though and determines which wrestler you\'re facing for attacks, blocks, and even tags. Since there\'s no easy onscreen indication of which wrestler you\'re actually facing, it\'s very easy to get confused in fast multiplayer matches, resulting in you hopping out of the ring instead of tagging, blocking in the wrong direction, or just kind of spinning around in circles like a moron. <P>There are also a whole lot of modes in the game, most of which are slight variations on the same type of match. You can throw down in standard versus matches, two-on-one fights, three-on-one matches, tornado bouts, and tag team contests, among others. There are also modes based on some of the WWF\'s more famous Pay-Per-View matches, like the Royal Rumble and the Survivor Series. The Rumble pits you against 29 other wrestlers in an over-the-top-rope brawl. In the real thing, a new wrestler hits the ring at a set interval, though here the number of simultaneous wrestlers never gets higher than four. There\'s some occasional slowdown in the Royal Rumble as new wrestlers are loaded on the fly without stopping the action, but it\'s very minor and doesn\'t get in the way of the game at all. Add to that various match conditions, like hard-core matches, I quit matches, or first blood, and you have enough options to keep you creating your own pay-per-views for months. --Jeff Gerstmann <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Four were devoted to movement in a very tank-tread type of way, enabling you to make very tight turns, and the fifth was for throwing cans. The default control on the PlayStation lets you play with the D-pad, but it really doesn\'t do the game justice. Thankfully, you can use the top L and R buttons to more accurately reflect the arcade\'s movement controls. Lastly, while the gameplay has remained intact, the sound, specifically the music, is pretty bad. <P>Rampage is another good game gone horribly wrong - and I\'m not talking about the annoying sequels that have been released in recent years. The old monster-smashing-buildings game plays like it\'s skipping two out of every three frames of animation, resulting in an extremely choppy game. Plus, the low screen resolution makes everything look really blurry. <P>""It is the nineties and there is time for... Klax!"" This is quite possibly the silliest game slogan to ever come out of an American developer. This puzzle game, based on catching tiles as they come off a conveyor belt and dropping them into a pit, was released as the Tetris craze was really starting to heat up. Klax is a good enough puzzle game, but it probably won\'t hold your attention in this age of Puyo Puyo and Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo. <P>720 used a custom controller - it was like a paddle controller, only there was a slanted joystick sticking out of it. This let you spin like crazy and pull off all the spinning skateboard tricks in the game. It would seem possible to use the Dual Shock analog stick in the game, and that appears to be what the developers tried to do, but it just doesn\'t work out very well, and you\'re stuck using the digital pad to simply turn left and right at a fixed speed. While the game is still sort of fun, it\'s very difficult to play with these controls, and they all but ruin the game. <P>Super Sprint, Atari\'s 1986 follow-up to the late \'70s black-and-white racing game Sprint, is a three-player driving game with great track design and car upgrades. The arcade version, which sported three steering wheels, demanded that you really get the wheel spinning as fast as possible to make some of the turns without having to slow down. It\'s harder to get that kind of turning radius on the Dual Shock, but the game still controls well enough to make it fun. <P>In my book, Smash TV is the crown jewel in this collection. The spiritual successor to Robotron: 2084, this dual-stick shooter was notoriously hard. The unlimited, free continues in this home version take a little bit of the challenge out of the game, but it\'s still amazingly fun. The translation is reasonably good, runs at full speed, and has excellent control with the digital pad. You can also use the analog sticks to move and shoot, but since your character will only move and fire in eight directions, the analog sticks are slightly more difficult to use. <P>The great conversion of Smash TV alone makes this pack worth picking up. Fans of 720 and Toobin\' will be disappointed by the PlayStation\'s lackluster control, and Rampage fans will simply be disgusted. Hopefully a pack with games like Narc, Total Carnage, and maybe even the original Mortal Kombat won\'t be too far behind. --Jeff Gerstmann <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

444,South Park,"[""Cartman, Kyle, Stan, and Kenny hop from the tube to the PlayStation in this mischief-filled game. You'll have the daunting task of saving South Park from a comet heading straight for South Park. In a bit of humor that is typical of the <i>South Park</i> series, the comet is visible only every 666 years. Defense comes via an arsenal of weapons that includes sniper chickens, cow launchers, snowballs (white and yellow), and Mr. Hanky the Christmas poo, who leaves a trail of you-know-what. Among the enemies, which change with each of the game's five episodes, are loud-mouthed turkeys that pop from the butts of larger turkeys, as well as mutant clones."", ""<i>South Park's</i> five episodes are broken into sublevels and are introduced by familiar characters, such as Chef. Of course, this game is filled with warped and off-color humor. For example, a fart sound denotes toggling between menu choices and a tally for quantity of helpless animals killed. You weren't expecting this game to be politically correct, were you?"", ""Drawbacks include the repetitious music and character voices, as well as the slow onscreen movement, which impedes the game's multiplayer capabilities. The simple graphics used in the television show do not translate as effectively into this format. Lastly, the playing area is too expansive and visibility is often limited due to the white-on-white winter setting. <i>--Kasty Thomas</i>"", '<b>Pros:</b>', '', 'Remember that show South Park? Remember how amazingly funny the movie was? Remember that lame first-person shooter that Acclaim put out for the PC and N64? Now that some people have started including the phrase ""back when the show was still funny"" in their descriptions of South Park, Acclaim has released its already weak South Park 3D shooter on the PlayStation. The game that is not only old (the N64 version was released about ten months ago), but it is also devoid of any fun whatsoever.', ""Rather than stick with existing voice work, Acclaim produced custom speech with Trey Parker, Matt Stone, and Isaac Hayes, so the storyline is properly voiced throughout the game. The speech really goes a long way in making the story (a comet is passing near South Park, wackiness ensues) at least listenable. Each episode is broken up into a few sublevels. The enemies usually remain the same from sublevel to sublevel and change entirely between levels. The first episode forces you to deal with hundreds of insane turkeys, while the second pits you against hundreds of mutant clones. The enemies change, but the game pretty much remains the same. You, playing as one of the four kids, pick up the other three kids. From there, you have a couple levels packed with the enemy du jour as well as with larger versions of enemies called tanks, which generate the smaller monsters. Occasionally, you'll get tossed into a level where you must destroy several tanks very quickly to keep them from destroying South Park. Then you'll face the level's boss, save the town from destruction, listen to Chef talk about how good you are, and move on. The Chef cutscenes are done in prerendered video clips, and they look as though someone had hooked the N64 version of the game up to a VCR, recorded all the clips, and digitized them for the PlayStation version. The game also has two-player multiplayer, but the weapons (dodge balls, dart guns, etc.), level design (way too big), and player movement (eternally sluggish) really don't lend themselves very well to the multiplayer game."", ""Speaking of level design, it's really quite bad, but given the license, it at least makes sense. You'll spend a good portion of your time in extremely large, open areas, such as the middle of the street, large fields, and the like. This leads to a very close horizon, complete with loads of pop-up. Plus, since the ground and fog are both white, you'll eventually spend some time staring at a completely white screen, hoping that you're actually moving and not just bumping up against a wall of snow. Sure, it's a cold, snowy Colorado town, so visibility is naturally low, but it still gets in the way of the gameplay. So with the fog as bad as it is, you're forced to stare at your radar almost constantly."", ""South Park (the show) has a pretty basic art style. It's pretty hard to mess it up. But the PlayStation version, with its reduced-poly models and bad video quality, somehow manages to look absolutely terrible. The only thing uglier than the graphics is the in-game sound - 90 percent of it is the repetitive, super-annoying noises made by the monsters. Five minutes of constant turkey gobbling in the first level will be enough to drive some from the game. Also, the kids speak from time to time, usually to announce that you've acquired a weapon or item, but this, too, is extremely limited and repetitive."", ""Between the abysmal graphics, bad sound, and horrible gameplay, South Park is definitely one of those games that is bound to come up when you start thinking about the worst game you've ever played. It's a real throwback to the days of completely worthless games with decent licenses - the kind Acclaim used to be infamous for back in the days of 8-bit and 16-bit gaming.

447,Ghosts 'n Goblins,"[""Now you can play the classic game <i>Ghosts &amp; Goblins</i> while on the go! The Game Boy Color version of Capcom's popular action-adventure game features seven challenging levels of haunting fun. Players command the heroic Sir Arthur, as he begins his quest to defeat the forces of evil and save his kidnapped girlfriend, Guinevere. Scores of evil enemies await Sir Arthur, from zombies to gargoyles, in his quest to save her. Will he survive the perils that await him in the haunted countryside of <i>Ghosts &amp; Goblins</i>?"", ""In 1985, Capcom released a little side scroller called Makai-Mura to Japanese arcades. That game, which soon after appeared in US arcades under the name Ghosts N' Goblins, sticks out in many gamers' minds as one of the first truly great side scrollers. It's also remembered as being unbelievably difficult to complete. The game was translated to the NES, and now it's come to the Game Boy Color. The translation to the Game Boy Color stays very true to the original's gameplay while adding a password function to allow for multisession gaming. The story is as old as time itself. You, as Arthur the knight, are kicking it in the graveyard with your best girl. Satan, big meanie that he is, simply can't have this, so a winged demon swoops down, kidnaps your lady friend, and vanishes. What's a knight to do? Get into his armor and start running to the right, of course! You'll make your way from the graveyard through lava-filled levels and caves and eventually to the castle where your fair maiden is being kept. Arthur's attacks are weapon based. You'll start out throwing lances, but as you progress you'll change to weapons such as a sword, an axe, or everyone's least favorite weapon, the torch. Taking one hit from an enemy will blow you out of your armor; taking another will kill you. Graphically, the game puts on a pretty good show, mimicking the NES version's graphics more than the arcade version. The soundtrack is faithful to the original version in melody, but the music and sound effects sound a bit like they're being piped through the Commodore 64's SID chip. Overall, the sound is very good. Portable-console players looking for a side scroller won't be disappointed with Ghosts N' Goblins. The control is easy to master, but the game manages to throw enough difficult enemies at you to keep you entertained. Overall, it's a great version of a real classic.<i>--Jeff Gerstmann</i>--<i>Copyright  1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

448,Silhouette Mirage,"['After more than a year of delays, Working Designs has finally delivered Silhouette Mirage. This isn\'t the same Silhouette Mirage that debuted on the Saturn nearly three years ago, however - the game has somehow transformed from a delightfully quirky platforming romp into an average, unbalanced, and tedious exercise meant for ""hard-core gamers."" In typical Treasure fashion, Silhouette Mirage\'s 2D gameplay is integrated with a lot of story and dialogue. The Edo computer system has malfunctioned, splitting the world\'s creatures into two opposing classes, Silhouette and Mirage. In the midst of a massive civil war between these two factions, a lone guardian possessing both attributes, Shyna Nera Shyna, wakes to set the Edo system right. Unfortunately, the memory of the Edo system\'s location was lost during Shyna\'s long slumber, forcing her to entrust her fate to a bug, a friendly Mirage summoner. In her quest, Shyna will face some of the weirdest and most evil characters to ever grace gaming. Silhouette Mirage\'s game mechanics are certainly innovative, if a little complex. Each of Shyna\'s two sides embodies one of the attributes of Silhouette and Mirage, as do all weapons, depending on which side is facing the enemy. Only the Mirage side of a weapon can injure Silhouette enemies and vice versa. All of the game\'s parasitic weapons, bought from rabbity salesmen scattered throughout the game, are powered by Shyna\'s spirit level. As weapons are fired, Shyna\'s spirit level drops, weakening her attacks as it diminishes. You can refill your spirit meter by draining enemies of their spirit energy, done by attacking Mirage enemies with Mirage weapons and vice versa. Dealing with Shyna\'s split personality is made easier through a variety of strategic throws, slides, and flips to manipulate the enemy\'s position relative to Shyna so the appropriate side can attack. Fortunately, the game provides you with an extensive tutorial illustrating and training you to pull off all of these moves. In addition to the strategic moves, Shyna can grapple enemies with her hair and beat money from their pockets - money that can be used to buy new weapons, health, and spirit energy. Confused yet? It\'s normal - Silhouette Mirage\'s complex play mechanics take some getting used to, and fully understanding the Silhouette/Mirage concept is crucial to winning the game, especially when fighting the game\'s awesome bosses. The need to drain enemies of their spirit energy is new to the US version and is the single greatest flaw in the game. Not only does this force you to constantly ration firepower, it also weakens your weapons as you fire them. As a result, a weapon will oftentimes not be there when you need it most. Compounding this problem is the inflated cost of weapons. The US version significantly ups the price of the game\'s weapons, forcing you to beat each and every enemy if you want a half-decent arsenal. As a result, the price for using weapons other than the boring one you start with is precipitously high and will cause some players to opt in favor of simply not buying weapons for most of the game. Additionally, if you want to succeed in the game, expect to spend lots of time tediously robbing and draining every enemy before you kill it. A new two-player battle mode is unlocked if you complete all five of the game\'s paths with fewer than nine lives, but this little doodad is hardly worth the boredom and effort required to achieve it - most players will probably put the game away after completing one path. Because Silhouette Mirage is a port of an old Saturn game, it is probably no surprise that the graphics are dated. While the style is appropriately wacky, there\'s very little that\'s impressive about Silhouette Mirage\'s graphics, even if the game ""pushes the 2D capabilities of your PlayStation game console to its limit."" While Silhouette Mirage\'s catchy, upbeat tunes are perfectly suited for the game, the localization team has outdone itself in the annoying-voice department. The game\'s unnecessary rebalancing makes this especially obvious; for example, players will be forced to hear Shyna yell ""BAM!"" every time she hits an enemy up for cash. Those interested in playing Silhouette Mirage should look in their favorite importer\'s bargain bins, as what was once a perfectly fun game is now an unrewarding chore overwrought with tedium. While you won\'t get to see the exclusive Lunar 2 video, you\'ll be treated to a far more competent and enjoyable game experience.

Between bites of pizza or slurps of soda, you played as a warrior of light slapped into an endless series of randomly generated dungeon levels, where you fought a slew of evil denizens. Not too long ago, Gauntlet suffered the fate of many classic games: It was given a major facelift and reinvented for the '90s. Unfortunately, Gauntlet Legends wasn't a particularly good arcade game, and it isn't any better on the N64. <P>Those of you unfamiliar with the arcade version of the remake  will at least be familiar with the unchanged premise. You still act as one of four characters (warrior, valkyrie, wizard, or archer) who make a stand against a seemingly bottomless reservoir of baddies. All the while you'll collect treasure, play with magic, and dish out the hurt. However, there have been some additions to the formula: You'll now be able to buy stuff with that treasure; levels now have themes; and you'll have to go up against bosses at the end of certain stages. And now our little elven archer buddy is a she. <P>Gauntlet Legends takes advantage of Nintendo's RAM pak, but don't expect it to look nearly as good as most other games that do. It seems as though there was a polygon shortage around the time of this game's development, as everything has a real flat look to it. Gauntlet Legends tried to take the birds-eye-view concept of the original and transfer it into a 3D environment, but this simply doesn't work, and you end up playing essentially the same old game with prettier looking backgrounds. Even though  my character was now climbing volcanic mountains, exploring temples, and trekking through the East, I still would have preferred the basic, randomly generated 2D dungeon. Maybe there was just something special about the carbon-copy levels contained in the original that made Gauntlet so enjoyable. (Or maybe it was because I was twelve. Who knows?) <P>The gameplay hasn't changed. You're still meandering about, opening doors, collecting treasure, and killing everything around you. And, just as in the arcade version, you don't even have to hit the attack button if you don't want to - it'll automatically strike enemies for you when you get close. This makes the game extremely one-hand friendly, and it takes the challenge of out playing. Although there's a new money system that lets you buy power-ups, I found that I was instead collecting power-ups and selling them just to buy my health back. And on the audio front, you'll be sick of the God-like voice that reads all the obvious game hints for you by the second level. In fact, there's really nothing great about the sound in the game. The music is mediocre at best, and the sound effects are repetitive.  <P>Gauntlet Legends boils down to another top-down fantasy button masher. There's nothing innovative here, and the game is neither enthralling nor interesting. There's no real motivation to complete the game, and the reward you receive once you do makes you regret the time you had invested in the game. Unfortunately, this game is another piece of evidence that indicates that some classics should be left well enough alone. --Ben Stahl <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

450,Paperboy,"[""Back in the early '80s, Midway rolled out the destined-to-be-a-classic arcade game <i>Paper Boy</i>, in which bike-riding players delivered newspapers to subscribers while avoiding numerous pitfalls and obstacles. Ports to home gaming systems through the years kept the kid's career active, and now <i>Paper Boy</i> is promoted to the Nintendo 64 platform in a familiar, yet entirely unique, 3-D action adventure."", ""As in the original version, Paper Boy must deliver the daily news to subscribers' homes, landing each toss perfectly to avoid canceled subscriptions. To add to the kid's stress, his or her paper route traverses more than two dozen hazard-laden neighborhoods, from the classic suburban sprawl to arid desert communities to deep forest dwellings. Along the way, the player rides into a mess of dangers: in addition to crazed animals and inattentive drivers, the end of the century brings such prophetic hazards as spewing volcanoes and invading aliens."", ""No longer stuck on a straight path, players explore the 3-D world with full freedom of movement. In addition, Paper Boy now performs all sorts of tricks--bunny hops, flips, spins--that help him or her along the way. Keep on rollin', old buddy. <i>--Eric Twelker</i>"", ""Like many classic arcade games that have been redesigned and rereleased on a current console, Paper Boy has traded in its handlebars in favor of an N64 controller. While the premise is still the same - deliver papers to doorsteps and mailboxes while avoiding cars, dogs, burglars, and other oddities - now, the young newspaper-distribution engineer gets to roam about in a fully 3D environment. But while Paper Boy 64 tries its best to stay close to its arcade roots, it strays too far from the tried-and-true Paper Boy formula and doesn't really deliver the classic arcade experience. The biggest and most noticeable difference between the two games is the new environment in Paper Boy 64. The isometric 2D world has been replaced with a fully 3D environment. So, instead of only delivering papers to the left side of the street, the new paperboy gets to handle both sides of the road, alleyways, and even a boardwalk or two. Best of all, you have total freedom to roam about - meaning you can make your own routes to the houses you deliver to. So, if you miss a house, you can now turn around and give it another shot. And instead of poor aim being your principal enemy, a time limit in each level and a health meter are the only things that will slow you down. The new Paper Boy shows more of a level structure, instead of the single street you were up against in the original. This new level system also includes bosses. If you've delivered enough papers to enough houses, you'll unlock a boss level, and once you have defeated the boss, you can move along into different areas of the game. Another new addition to the game is a power-up system - now you can collect extra time, health, booster packs, and other items to help you along your way. Everything in the new Paper Boy has an oversimplified polygonal look to it. Houses, trailers, dogs, and even the paperboy himself look as though they were designed and rendered on an ancient Amiga. Other nice graphical additions are the different themes of the courses themselves. Instead of just traveling through typical suburban neighborhoods the whole game, you'll bounce around to seaside communities, trailer parks, and camping grounds, just to name a few. Each level has its own vehicles, pedestrians, houses, and obstacles. You'll run into roller-skating goat demons in the mad-scientist level, angry pelicans in the seaside level, and runaway moose in the camping level. This definitely adds some needed variety to the Paper Boy formula. The sounds are pretty lame. The main theme that runs over the game's soundtrack is an updated version of the classic Paper Boy tune. Perhaps in an attempt to seem tied to the original, all the sound effects and speech sound really dated. Unfortunately, this doesn't help the retro-game effect the game may have been trying to achieve - instead, it just ends up sounding poor. Because you're in a completely new environment, a completely new control scheme had to be devised. Instead of just tapping a button to toss a paper to your left, you'll now have both a left and right paper-tossing button. You can also hold down the paper-toss button and steer your throws with a helpful onscreen arrow. The new Paper Boy also has buttons that control speed, so you don't have to rely on the control stick itself to do the job. And one of the most surprising control elements is the new jump button, which lets you simply hop over obstacles. The control system is pretty rudimentary, and it lets you take command of the Paperboy without any major learning process. While a decent game on its own, Paper Boy 64 doesn't capture the magic of the original arcade game. People looking to relive the magic of Paper Boy would be better off playing the ported version, available to PlayStation owners on the Midway Presents Arcade's Greatest Hits: The Atari Collection 2 disc, or - better yet - by tracking down an arcade cabinet - handlebars and all.<i>--Ben Stahl</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Separate character storylines and items  that move after each game keep players coming back for more gore."", 'The hulking 512-megabit game pack is the largest to hit the Nintendo 64, and for good  reason.

Heck, the third game in the series, Resident Evil 3 Nemesis, was released on the PlayStation two weeks ago, and the fourth installment, Resident Evil: Code Veronica, is due out for the Dreamcast in Japan in a few months, with a US translation trailing only a bit behind. Somehow, though, RE2 doesn\'t feel old or tired at all. And it\'s as impressive today on the N64 as it was in January of \'98, when it first debuted on the PlayStation. Part of that is due to how impressive it is as a port. The game takes the contents of two PlayStation discs - including all the FMV sequences and the bonus Hunk and Tofu missions - and fits it into one 512-megabit N64 cartridge, which ends up being twice the size of The Legend of Zelda cart, for the record. The only thing missing in this edition is the extreme-battle mode from the Dual Shock edition of Resident Evil 2 on the PlayStation, but the omission is made up for by new features, such as a randomizer (which shuffles items around after you\'ve played the game through once) and files (which you can find to learn details about the Resident Evil story, some of which have bits that tie in with Resident Evil 3 Nemesis and Resident Evil: Code Veronica). You can also change the blood color from red to green or blue, or set the violence to low, medium, or high. Sure, and the gang\'s all here. You play as Leon Kennedy, the rookie cop who has reported for his first shift on the day the T-virus outbreak turns the whole town into zombies, or as Claire Redfield, who has come to Raccoon City to find her older brother, the male lead from the first Resident Evil. To make matters worse, the creator of the T-virus has developed a more perfect virus, which he ingests when the nefarious Umbrella Corporation sends in troops to steal it from him. (In the process, he\'s become a monster that could even give RE\'s Tyrant pause). Yes, as either character, you end up in the middle of company politics and a lot of sharp, gnashing teeth. Resident Evil 2 on the PlayStation was full of moments that made you sense that something was going to pop out and attack you (and invariably, something did as soon as you stopped expecting it), and that\'s reproduced perfectly here. The sound effects are fantastic, whether it\'s the moan and shuffle of a zombie that\'s just around the corner or the crunch of your footsteps as you step over broken glass. And save for a slightly tinny quality, the sounds and the dramatic score of the game are just as good on cart as they were on CD.  The graphics are even more of a wonder. If you use the N64 expansion pak, the visuals are bumped into hi-res mode, making them look even better than those in the PlayStation version. But even without the pak, they\'re still very impressive. Sometimes, the backgrounds look washed out while the characters remain brightly hued, making them stand out strangely, but it\'s a very rare occasion when that happens. The game\'s frame rate also slows down a bit when numerous monsters are onscreen at once, but not enough to affect gameplay. And though the computer-generated FMV sequences look grainy in comparison with the PlayStation version, they still look fantastic considering the cart format. Of course, the same complaints relevant to the PlayStation original still apply to the N64 version. You\'ll find that the camera is your worst enemy: When you move into an area of the room that you hadn\'t been able to see before you\'ll get ambushed by several zombies that were standing just into the next screen. Or when you\'re blasting away at a boss or sub-boss, the recoil of your weapon will knock you into another screen, and you\'ll get killed because you don\'t know which side you\'re going to be attacked from. And you\'ll continue to believe that the strange inventory system should\'ve long since been changed to something more like Diablo\'s ""smaller items take up less space/big items take up more space"" system. But even with those few detractions, Resident Evil 2 is still as much an experience as it is a game. A huge improvement over the first title, RE2 succeeds in making you feel as though you\'re in the middle of a horror film - one in which you\'ll jump many, many times. If you\'ve already played the PlayStation or PC versions of RE2, there\'s really no reason to buy this game, but for N64 owners who haven\'t tried yet, it\'s an absolute must-have.<i>--Joe Fielder</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

453,NBA Showtime: NBA on NBC,"[""Midway is one of those third-party publishers that will put every game on every platform possible. As such, NBA Showtime, the company's latest arcade basketball game, is coming to the Dreamcast, the Nintendo 64, the PlayStation, and, yes, the Game Boy. The Nintendo 64 version manages to feature most of the options and gameplay of the arcade version, but the sound and graphics have taken a rather large hit. NBA Showtime is essentially the latest iteration of the arcade basketball classic, NBA Jam. The most obvious upgrade from Jam to Showtime is graphical. The game is now in full 3D, as opposed to NBA Jam's 2D looks. The arcade version of Showtime featured extremely nice player models. The player heads looked outstanding. While the arcade version had players that looked real (to the point of being downright frightening at times), the N64 just can't push the required number of polygons to deliver that arcade look. As such, the characters look blocky, the crowd doesn't move, the ball leaves an ugly motion trail, and other graphical tweaks have been made. These tweaks allow the game to run at a playable speed, but some playability issues have been introduced that don't quite match up with the arcade version. Some of the dunks are missing frames of animation, causing players to suddenly teleport from about two feet away from the rim and sink the ball. Needless to say, this makes blocking dunks - an exercise in timing and skill - much more difficult. Also, three-pointers seem slightly easier to sink when you have opposing players in your face - a phenomenon that is exactly opposite from the arcade version. Unlike Jam, Showtime actually calls fouls. After one human player (computer players are allowed to be as nasty as they want to be) commits five fouls in one quarter, a player from the opposing team is sent to the line for a free throw, worth three points. Now, at first, the concept of fouls in a no-rules arcade basketball game may seem like a horrible idea, but it actually balances the game out fairly well and keeps it from degenerating into huge shove fests. The arcade version of the game featured a lot of speech, including the calling out of every player name. This is gone from the N64 version, but a good deal of phrases from both the announcer and the players remain. The gameplay is vintage NBA Jam. It's two-on-two basketball at its finest, complete with huge dunks, alley-oops, shoves, swats, and lots and lots of goaltending. The ball never goes out of bounds, and aside from goaltending and the occasional foul call, the only other rule is the shot clock. You've got a turbo button, a pass/steal button, and a shoot/jump button at your disposal. You'll control the same player throughout the game, so if you don't have a human teammate, you'll have to issue commands to your teammate when he's carrying the ball. You can call for a pass or command the computer player to shoot the ball. Double tapping turbo executes a quick evasive spin or dodge move that you can use to get past pesky defenders. The game features a create-a-player mode, which lets you pick a head for your player as well as customize several stats, such as height, weight, dunking ability, and power. You can pick a jersey number and the name the announcer would call you, but since you can't see the jersey numbers on any of the players, and the player name speech isn't in the N64 version, having these options just seems silly. As you win games with a created player, you'll earn new points you can use in the various stat categories. Aside from the aforementioned gameplay bugs, the game controls reasonably well. You use the analog stick to simulate the arcade game's 49-way joysticks. Because the player models look a little funky, it's occasionally hard to tell which way you're pointed when all four players crowd together. This makes accurate shoves and steals tough. It's not perfect, but NBA Showtime is still a fun four-player game, and it's worlds better than the team's last N64 arcade basketball translation, NBA Hangtime. Give it a three-day rental, and see if you're left hungry for more.<i>--Jeff Gerstmann</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

This year's Madden NFL 2000 once again demonstrates why the series has remained on top for ten years - and also why its competitors think they can topple the mighty champion."", 'Everything that is great about Madden 2000 revolves around the gameplay itself.

You control the players effortlessly, and the running game in particular benefits from your having the ability to hit a hole between two offensive lineman. The players also hold their blocks well, allowing for realistic runs.', ""Unlike many previous Madden games, the passing game in Madden 2000 takes some getting used to. The challenge, which takes several games to learn, is to look either for a receiver who has separated himself from his covering defender or for a receiver who's wide open, before throwing the ball. Forcing a ball into tight coverage will result in an incompletion at best and an interception at worst."", ""The practice mode helps you to understand this, as well as the running game and the need to accelerate into the holes as soon as they appear. All offensive and defensive formations are available in the practice mode, and figuring out which offenses work, and more importantly don't work, against certain defenses is important for beating the computer AI at the harder levels of difficulty."", ""Madden 2000's graphics are generally excellent, and the overall presentation is top quality. But the little touches are just superb. It is natural for you to make the quarterback backpedal prior to a passing attempt. But in reality, a quarterback who throws while backpedaling will throw off his back foot and have less zip on the ball. This is the case in Madden 2000, where the quarterback must stop if he's going to make a good pass. You'll notice other details, like how a running back fights for extra yardage while in the grasp of a would-be tackler, or how his helmet pops off after a strong tackle. If judged solely on its gameplay, Madden 2000 would be an undisputed winner."", 'However, everything that is good about the gameplay is almost overshadowed by an incredibly frustrating navigational interface. It would be difficult to come up with an interface this bad if you were trying. Its clunky counterintuitive keyboard layout alternately stymies and frustrates any attempts to reasonably move around this game.', ""That's a shame, because Madden 2000 has some great ideas, like a fantasy draft, full general manager control, a play editor, and customizable playbooks - and yet it's hard to imagine anyone using any of it for more than ten minutes without cursing and going back to season mode. Some years ago, Sierra's Front Page Sports Football set the standard for play editors and general manager functions, and EA should have caught up by now."", ""Regardless of its interface, the Madden series is known both as a great game and also as an attempt to simulate real football wherever possible. Games such as NFL Blitz opt for arcade-style gameplay instead, and for some reason EA felt the need to compete and add an arcade mode to Madden 2000. But that's not what Madden does best, and an arcade-style game with illegal procedure called for kicking the ball out of bounds isn't much fun. EA would have been better off sticking with what it knows."", ""In other ways, Madden 2000 feels a little rushed, as if it had to get out for the start of the football season. You'll sense this primarily in the commentary. While Pat Summerall is usually very relevant and informative, some of Madden's comments are just plain silly and inappropriate. Maybe the commentary isn't a big deal, but it seems strange in a game that is otherwise first-rate."", ""Madden 2000 also features a mode that includes ten scenarios from history's great games, which you must complete in order. This reward-for-success system is fine in this context but is taken to an extreme by introducing the concept of the Madden Challenge, in which you must earn points in order to unlock secret teams and more. This would be understandable in some other genre but doesn't make a whole lot of sense in a sports game."", ""Madden 2000 is both awesome and frustrating. It's a good football game, but it's only a so-so product. Completely overhauling the interface while leaving the gameplay intact would result in possibly the greatest football game ever. <i>--Colin Sloan</i> <br />--<i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Other details, like birds flying across the screen, are also very realistic and must be seen to be fully appreciated. Although tri-Ace is the developer responsible for the creation of Star Ocean: SS, it should be noted that the company was assisted in this project by Japanese CG house Links. Links may not sound familiar, but its works speak for itself. The company was responsible for much of the CG rendering in Final Fantasy VII and for creating the CG intros in all three Shining Force III games. Links' assistance is evident in Star Ocean's gorgeous opening movie, as well in the prerendered backgrounds which are easily on a par with FFVII and Parasite Eve. Although the game plays like an old-school RPG, it certainly doesn't look like one. <P>Battle scenes, on the other hand, switch to a fully polygonal backdrop, like Grandia, while the sprite-based characters duke it out in real time, which leads us to the next interesting feature of Star Ocean, and that's the battle engine. Depending on your familiarity with the Star Ocean battle system, you can choose from one of three settings during combat: standard, semi-active or full-active. Standard is for those who are new to the series, since the battles are fairly fast paced, while semi-active and full-active are for gamers who want more control over every aspect of the battles. In any case, as in the original, fights are fast paced and have an almost action-game feel to them. <P>During battle scenes, you can choose special attacks, which are learned during the course of the game. Once you have multiple characters in your party (which can number up to eight, with four on the battlefield), you can combine specials to create a super-specialty. Other features in the game include item creation, skill learning (after learning an appropriate amount of skills, you can combine them to acquire more-powerful specialties, and more. <P>Exploration takes you through myriad towns and villages, each of which has its own unique look. The usual suspects appear in great numbers: merchants, weapons shops, restaurants, inns, etc. Once you've filled your inventory with the necessary supplies, your travels will take you onto an overhead 3D-map, much like the one found in FFVII, where you will have to search for hidden caves and well-hidden harbor towns, among others. Spanning two discs, Star Ocean has plenty to see and do. <P>Possessing one of the more incredible soundtracks composed for a video game, Star Ocean's US translation is functional, although not as clever as some of Working Design's better work. Star Ocean: Second Story is an engaging RPG that ranks up there with the likes of Xenogears and Suikoden, with the storyline leading you on an incredible journey that's not as flashy as some, but certainly more substantial than others. With at least 50 hours of gaming in each character's scenario, Star Ocean might not be compelling enough to play through twice, but the first time is as engaging as any RPG you're likely to play. Highly recommended in any case. --James Mielke <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

472,Army Men Air Attack,"['Includes game only, NO CASE OR INSTRUCTIONS!!  Fast Shipping!!', '3DO has been milking the whole concept of little plastic army men as real-life soldiers for quite some time now. The PC has seen a couple of Army Men strategy games, while the console systems have received some weak games, such as Army Men 3D and Army Men: Sarge\'s Heroes. But you shouldn\'t give up on the Army Men series just yet. Army Men: Air Attack is a mission-based helicopter shooter that actually makes the little green guys fun to play with again. <P>Remember the Strike series, Electronic Arts\' line of mission-based helicopter shooters? Remember how bad the last few Strike games were? Air Attack plays a bit like the old, good Strike games. You, as a helicopter pilot for the Green army, embark on several missions in an attempt to defeat the insidious Tan army, led by General Plastro. Some levels take place in the plastic world, while some take place in the real world. Certain items act differently in each world. For instance, a lifeless real-world teddy bear becomes a valuable attack bear when brought through the portal and into the plastic world. The mission design is varied, with a heavy emphasis on ""wipe out every enemy in sight"" levels. Other missions will have you guarding trains, freeing colonies of bugs, and defending your base from an ant invasion. You\'ll have some pretty standard weaponry on your chopper, including machine guns, missiles, homing rockets, and napalm. But you can also use various objects in the environment as weapons. Don\'t like the looks of the well-defended Tan base up ahead? Pick up an apple, or perhaps a pinecone, and drop it on the enemy defenses. As you progress through the game, you\'ll earn new helicopters, each of which is rated in armor, mobility, weaponry, and winch speed. Your copilot selection also has an effect the accuracy of your guns, missiles, and winch. Each copilot has a ""personality,"" which manifests in three or four different one-liners. <P>Army Men: Air Attack makes good use of the analog controller. The left stick controls speed and heading. The right stick can be used to strafe left and right, but the L1 and R1 buttons accomplish this just as well. By combining turning and strafing, you can effectively circle-strafe around your enemies, making short work of them before most of them can even draw a bead on you. The winch works great, and items are easy to grab and drop, unlike in the later games in the Strike series, where you must have pinpoint accuracy. <P>With the exception of your copilot\'s chatter, which gets a little grating after a few levels, the sound effects are well done. Nothing too special or realistic-sounding. Little touches - like the bugs shouting, ""We\'re free!"" (in voices reminiscent of the little man insect at the end of The Fly) when liberated from their roach motel prisons - give the game a little more flair. The graphics are about as good as you can expect from a game based on a collection of green and tan plastic toys. Each unit has a bit of plastic shine. The terrain looks like grass, dirt, and mud without looking too blocky. <P>The main flaw of Air Attack is a general lack of difficulty. There are really only two or three missions that pose a real challenge; the rest of them are cakewalks once you\'ve gotten the control down well enough to dodge bullets. But even though you\'ll be able to skate through most of the game, there are a couple multiplayer modes that keep the game interesting. Cooperative mode lets you go through the main game with a friend. Flag Nab-It is a game of capture the flag, where you must infiltrate your opponent\'s base, steal his flag, and take it to your base to score. <P>While it may not completely wash away the bad taste left by Army Men 3D and Army Men: Sarge\'s Heroes, Army Men: Air Attack is a fun little mission-based shooter that is worth checking out. The ease of the game makes it a good rental, but the multiplayer is good enough to warrant purchasing the game. Fans of the 16-bit Strike games will be pleasantly surprised, also. --Jeff Gerstmann <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

484,"Star Trek: The Next Generation, Birth of the Federation","['<I>Star Trek: The Next Generation, Birth of the Federation</I> is the first PC CD-ROM strategy game based on the rich <I>Star Trek,</I> universe! Forged from the cultures, time lines, events, and technologies of the hit TV show <I>Star Trek: The Next Generation,</I> this turn-based epic emphasizes resource management, combat, and diplomacy. Control one of five major alliances: Federation, Klingon, Romulan, Ferengi, or Cardassian, each with its own set of abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. Encounter over 30 exotic races. And beware, there lurks the potential for a Borg invasion--threatening <I>all</I> players!', ""Anyone who has played Master of Orion will find Birth of the Federation very familiar. It is not so much that the game is an unofficial sequel to that classic space strategy game, but more that both games borrow so many features from Civilization. In many ways, Birth of the Federation is the next in the long line of MicroProse strategy games, breaking little from the mold set by Civilization and cemented by Master of Orion and Master of Magic. While each had its own distinct flavor, all these games shared many qualities. Birth of the Federation is no different. <P> The options in the game are as robust as any other MicroProse strategy title. You can vary your starting conditions in the game setup menu, but in general, you get a barely developed starting solar system and an imperative to conquer the rest of the galaxy. The options you can adjust include the starting technology level of the five major empires (Federation, Cardassian, Ferengi, Klingon, and Romulan), the number of minor races in the game (such as Vulcans, Nausicaans, and Betazoids), the shape of the galaxy, and the size of the galaxy. The shape dictates how you can travel in the galaxy, while the size determines how much territory you need to conquer and when you'll encounter your rivals. <P> Once in the game, you have to manage and guide your empire through technological research, diplomatic relations, espionage, military buildup, internal production, exploration, and outright ship-to-ship combat. The game starts off simply, as do all these games, but can get very complex and overwhelming. Those who don't have patience for the micromanagement might call the exponentially complex gameplay tedious, and indeed, each extra system to manage does add more repetitive action, but those who enjoy this kind of game won't be disappointed. <P> I did appreciate that the different races do act according to their Star Trek personae. The Klingons come off as aggressive warmongers, and the Ferengi sure sound like sneaky bastards. The Federation, predictably, was always last to declare war on me and always seemed to make quick friends with most of the minor races. As far as accurately representing the Star Trek universe, Birth of the Federation does a good job. <P> Unfortunately, the interface leaves much to be desired. It is a jumble of colors and icons, ensuring that beginners will spend a lot of time fumbling over buttons until they arrive at the desired action. For example, the descriptions of the troop transport don't tell you that the only way to build an outpost or starbase is by transforming an existing transport. You have to dig through the manual or stumble along until you figure that out. While there is a tutorial of sorts in the form of saved games, there really should have been an obvious tutorial with better help as one of the main menu options. <P> In addition, there should have been better documentation of each race's special buildings and concrete stats on their specific strengths. After all, this is a strategy game. It's already crammed with stats. There is no reason not to include stats in the manual if they let you know why you want to play a certain race. As it is, the manual says the Romulans have good intelligence, but it says the same for the Cardassians. Which is better? <P> Moreover, the futuristic setting is at a disadvantage as far as easing gamers into the game's complexity. Whereas Civilization has the benefit of using historical terms and units to define its gameplay, Birth of the Federation falls into the same trap as Firaxis Games' Alpha Centauri: It's not easy to tell the difference between futuristic technologies. <P> One other thing that bothered me were the voice-overs during combat. I wish there were a way to shut them off without turning voice off altogether. Otherwise, tactical combat is fine. It doesn't look too bad, although when you get large ships engaging small ones, it gets hard to spot the small vessels. At least you can zoom in and out and rotate at will. <P> While games of this nature tend to have very drawn-out endgames, Birth of the Federation addresses this problem to an extent by counting 60 percent conquest of the galaxy as victory. This is a great feature because having to crush every last vestige of the enemy's territory when you've already essentially won can get tedious. However, while this partial conquest victory condition is nice, it doesn't always prevent games from dragging out if you are on the losing end (in one game, it took 60 turns for the combined races of the galaxy to crush me, even though I had no ships and only one system). <P> Birth of the Federation is a good game, if you are willing to forgive the interface and the amount of micromanagement required. It definitely has a Star Trek feel to it, right down to the humanoid aliens and confusing technobabble. As for gameplay, it doesn't stray too far from the Master of Orion mold, making it a good, albeit familiar, game. <i>--Elliott Chin</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

491,Flag to Flag Cart Racing,"['Sega\'s <i>Flag to Flag CART Racing</i> brings the world\'s fastest  closed-circuit auto racing to Sega Dreamcast. Fully licensed by CART and  designed with the help of CART\'s champion ""Team Rahal,""  Sega has created an  accurate and realistic racing game for console gaming. Hold on tight as you race  through 19 real-life tracks including superspeed ovals, street, and road  courses. Choose from 27 official CART drivers from 17 different teams with  authentic stats. The graphics engine creates exact replicas of both cars and  courses down to the sponsor decals. Watch out for the variable weather and  lighting. With multiple gameplay modes (from Arcade to Simulation), you\'ll be  ready to burn rubber.', 'A surprising release in Japan shortly after the Dreamcast launch (considering C.A.R.T. racing is much more popular in America), Sega\'s CART Flag to Flag attempts to deliver the hands-on thrills of the sport in 128-bit power. While it\'s a quality effort, some glaring shortcomings and an overall lack of ""oomph"" relegate this game to ""could\'ve been better"" status. Let us dissect. <P>Developed by Zoom - those wacky guys responsible for the Zero Divide series and the obscure import fighter Rurouni Kenshin - Flag to Flag is more of a filler title for the Dreamcast\'s American launch than anything else. This becomes even more obvious with games like Scud Racer and Daytona 2 brewing on the horizon. As far as value is concerned, Flag to Flag certainly fulfills its responsibilities by providing 19 tracks to race on (Gold Coast, Laguna Seca, Rio De Janeiro, Gateway International, etc.), all the professional teams you could want to play as (Al Unser Jr.\'s team, Bobby Rahal\'s, and so on), and arcade and championship modes. <P>Arcade mode obviously brings a simple ""slam the gas and pass"" mentality to the game, while championship mode offers a more in-depth approach to C.A.R.T. racing. In championship mode, you can use a practice round to familiarize yourself with the upcoming track, tweak your car settings, participate in a qualifying session, and finally enter the race itself. <P>Car settings let you manipulate things like tire compounds, aerodynamics, fuel, suspension, gear ratio, and the transmission. Other options include weather settings, race length, car damage, corner signs, and full-course caution signs. Otherwise, everything here is basically straightforward. <P>This is, after all, a racing game.CART Flag to Flag\'s visuals are of consistently high quality, with two attractive ""in-cockpit"" perspectives to really give you the feeling of having your butt eight inches over the tarmac. In fact, one of those views even causes the ""driver"" to wipe the dirt from his visor on occasion. Track elements like dirt or sand will appear on your tires should you hit a shoulder or trackside, and the side-mounted rearview mirrors offer realistic reflections of the racers behind you. Unfortunately, of the 19 available tracks, none seems particularly different from each other, and everything seems to have a hazy, overcast feel to it. Some dramatic light sourcing could have helped matters, but everything seems a bit pale in general. The game runs at a smooth 30fps, which isn\'t bad considering the far line of sight you get with little draw-in and the large number of racers on track. The sounds seem to have been recorded from actual vehicles to enhance authenticity. Each car gives off a different rumble, and they all have a different feel when you are driving them. <P>The game is also compatible with Sega\'s racing wheel accessory, so armchair racers can really get into it. The problem, however, is the intrinsic nature of CART racing itself, which is mainly to drive around a large oval. Sure, tracks like Laguna Seca and Cleveland offer nasty corners and twists, but more often than not, it\'s big ovals for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Set the game to a high number of laps and you may dive off the track in your sleep. If it weren\'t for the convincing sense of speed and the great in-cockpit view, this game might just be one of the blandest racing ""experiences"" of the generation. The Dreamcast equivalent of Sega\'s F1 Challenge for the Saturn, Flag to Flag fulfills all its obligations, yet never really goes beyond them. Aimed mainly at the C.A.R.T. fan, other Dreamcast owners waiting for a great racer would be better advised to look into Sega Rally 2. --James Mielke <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

503,Worms Armageddon,"['It was the good PC game for your computers and laptops to play on for Worms fans only.', ""The spineless and unassuming critters that star in Worms Armageddon epitomize the game itself. You'll quickly notice that the worms in this game are not as meek as they appear and instead are funny, ill-tempered, and wickedly clever. At about the same time, you'll find that while this game may look cute, it is in fact as sophisticated and enjoyable as the very best strategy games out there. It's also highly polished, easily customizable, accessible to all ages, and perfectly suited for quick spells and marathon sessions alike. <P> That said, it's true that Worms Armageddon isn't all that different from Worms 2. Though it includes an all-new single-player campaign and fully integrated online play, as well as over a dozen new weapons and gadgets for the worms to use, Armageddon looks, sounds, and plays similarly to the last episode, which means veterans of the series expecting something totally new will not find what they're looking for. And everyone else will wish Worms Armageddon offered even more, if only because it's as good as it is. <P> Worms Armageddon is easy to play and control, two factors that contribute immensely to the game's success. The typical skirmish pits teams of worms against each other, all randomly interspersed throughout some sort of exaggerated landscape ranging from garbage dumps to stacks of books. You take turns with your opponents, inching your forces into position one by one and firing upon enemy worms with an arsenal of weapons, from traditional (grenade, shotgun) to makeshift (baseball bat, blowtorch) to unorthodox (exploding old woman, skunk). The worms even know a few famous martial arts moves for good measure. Most worm weapons are absurd and amusing, and effectively serve specific functions. But since many do overlap in functionality, you can be selective and creative with your arsenal rather than feel restricted by it. You'll witness the events that transpire as the worms duel to the death via a traditional 2D platform-game side view, lending Worms Armageddon a readily approachable if misleadingly simple appearance. <P> So although it may appear as if that one worm over there just fired a bazooka at his enemy across the screen, aiming that shot was anything but trivial. A worm, not unlike a golfer, needs to take into account such elements as trajectory, wind direction, and power, and although shooting simply involves arrow keys and the space bar, hitting the target won't be quite so simple. Even seemingly fail-safe weapons, like homing missiles and napalm strikes, require skill and foresight to be used effectively. What's more, explosive attacks, such as the bazooka, vaporize the terrain around the targeted area, likely causing the worms in the vicinity to be flung about. It's often to your advantage to try to destroy the earth from under the feet of your enemies rather than target them directly, in an effort to send them careening into the water below, since worms can't swim. <P> Thanks to the game's sophisticated physics and damage modeling, the results of your attacks will often prove surprising no matter how accurate you think you are. Since maps tend to be strewn with explosives, and the worms themselves explode when they die, oftentimes the results of a successful strike are anything but predictable as an incredible chain reaction ensues. This tightly controlled chaos, together with the precise targeting system and plausible physics, is also essential to this game's success. And the automatic instant replay on especially unbelievable chains of events is a nice touch. <P> Great graphics and sound don't hurt, either. Worms Armageddon includes a seemingly endless assortment of beautiful and surreal backdrops, which lend most every skirmish a unique challenge, since these landscapes are randomly generated each time. The worms themselves are animated beautifully, and their articulate expressions and bizarre arsenals make these some of the most endearing computer game characters in a long time. Meanwhile, special effects such as fire and explosions all look equally good, lending the game a perfectly consistent and always bright and attractive appearance. <P> The sound effects that accentuate the firefights, while somewhat repetitive, are as over-the-top and amusing as the graphics, while a rather remarkably grandiose militaristic soundtrack enhances the game's tongue-in-cheek half-seriousness. More remarkable still is to what extent you can customize your worms: As a holdover from its predecessor, Worms Armageddon includes dozens upon dozens of sound schemes for the little guys, most of which are high-pitched, angry squeals. You can make your worms speak Russian, Greek, Afrikaans, around a dozen dialects of English, French, Spanish, German, you name it. Or you can import your own sound effects, just as you can also select a team anthem, an insignia, a tombstone, and customize just about everything else about your team, giving it a unique style that will distinguish you among your peers in a grueling multiplayer match. <P> Those custom features aptly suggest that Worms Armageddon lends itself perfectly to multiplayer competition. The fully integrated Worms.net Internet play server (though not ideally fast or reliable at all hours as of press time) lets you easily join a game with rival worm commanders from across the world, and the server even maintains your ranking and status based on your wins and losses. Because battles are highly customizable, such that starting conditions for health and ammunition can be easily adjusted, you can join games that emphasize the style of play you prefer, either in favor of mass-destructive or more strategic weaponry. In between multiplayer sessions, you can play against the computer in quick matches or deathmatch battles that become progressively more challenging, just as you can learn the ropes through a convenient if somewhat difficult training mode, then apply them in the single-player campaign. The campaign missions, which must be played through linearly, are mostly puzzle-oriented and recall Psygnosis' classic Lemmings in that they tend to force you to make precise use of a limited supply of tools in order to accomplish your objectives. The puzzle elements of these missions oftentimes prove frustrating, since many of these missions are very difficult, and while the campaign provides an enjoyable diversion from the rest of the game, it doesn't really hold up on its own, nor does it seem intended to do so. <P> Likewise, although the computer opponent is realistically fallible except at the highest skill levels, it tends to neglect the more obscure or sophisticated weapons available, resorting to mundane explosives nine times out of ten. For this reason alone, the computer cannot ever hope to provide the sort of unique competition that is practically assured with even the most inexperienced human opponent, whose foibles and follies in combat will likely be worth the price of admission if he isn't good enough to fight back in earnest. <P> It's too bad that the computer opponent doesn't make full use of its full arsenal, and as you play Armageddon more and more, invariably you'll also wish the game had even more weapons, even more diversity in graphics and sound, and even more of pretty much everything. There's no mistaking that Worms Armageddon is both highly polished and totally complete, with far more features and variety and options than just about any other game out there. Nevertheless, the design and execution are so great and so open-ended that you'll know, even as you log more and more hours with the game, that in fact you can't have too much of a good thing. <i>--Greg Kasavin</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

In between the units are video briefings, which do a good job of laying out your objective. But because of limitations of the Unreal engine, the videos always play in a separate window, putting your computer on window-swapping mayhem whenever a briefing pops up. Don't even bother with viewing the introduction, because it's Klingon History 101, using stiff animations combined with stock footage of volcanoes, and it's a real yawner."", ""The level design in the early part of the game is lackluster but gets better as the game progresses. I was about to dismiss the game by the second level, but luckily, as I played some more, I was rewarded with some really interesting design later on. You get to tour locales such as the Rure Penthe prison that was seen in Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, a space station, and even a Klingon Bird of Prey (both inside and out). The later levels show off the Unreal engine's color and aesthetics, and were laid out in a logical fashion and utilized some interesting triggers (such as a prison riot)."", 'The enemy design doesn\'t progress as nicely though. The Klingons replace the Skaarj, which means you basically fight the same Klingons over and over, except they change clothing and weapons depending on where you fight them. They retain the dodging maneuvers of Unreal\'s Skaarj, and they also ""play dead"" at times. The levels are also more populated here than in Unreal, so you face a lot of Klingons, which got a bit tiresome for me. The other enemies include your standard security robot type, some Andorians (who seem to be like Klingons but slower), the Nausicaans (Klingons but uglier), and some annoying animals (dogs, scorpions, and pigs). The only really interesting enemy is the Lethian, because it has stealth capabilities.', 'The weapon design is average, with four token Star Trek weapons, some standard weapons found in most other shooters, and one really nice ubergun. The two Star Trek guns are the disruptor pistol and rifle, which have the saving grace of a nice disintegration effect, and the other two weapons are a knife and the Bat\'Leth (that curved Klingon battle sword). Then we have the spinning disk from Unreal, the rocket launcher (with an additional twist of heat-seeking rockets), the grenade launcher, and a rail gun (called ""Sith Har"" here). The ubergun, the particle dispersal cannon, is really nice because it either fires a massive energy wave or creates a miniature black hole.', 'And while MicroProse made a lot of tweaks to the engine, the multiplayer is still hampered by the limitations that have plagued Unreal. MicroProse is promising to work with Epic on the infamous multiplayer patch, but for now, consider Klingon Honor Guard to be a single-player game.', ""Klingon Honor Guard is a decent action game utilizing the Star Trek franchise. It's fun to wield that famed Bat'Leth - the Klingon-style one-liners your character dishes out are amusing. If you're a Star Trek fan, you'll probably appreciate the levels and enemies. But judged on its merits as a shooter, Klingon Honor Guard suffers because of its average design. <i>--Thierry Nguyen</i> <br />--<i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

509,MechWarrior 3 - PC,"['Prepare to walk the walk, MechWarrior.', ""The Inner Sphere's long-awaited counterattack against the vicious Clan Smoke Jaguar rages on, but the enemy isn't willing to lie down and die. On a world with the ironic name of Tranquil, one of the last ranking Smoke Jaguar star colonels is preparing a bastion for his clan to lick its wounds and prepare its vengeance. Your mission: conduct a high-impact commando raid on Tranquil and destroy its usefulness as a base of operations before the enemy has a chance to dig in.<P>The tricky part is, MechWarrior, that the Jaguars know they're beaten and, honorable or not, they're going to try everything to see that they get their shot at vengeance against the Inner Sphere. You can bet they're going to start with the closest target--you."", ""The greatest feat a science-fiction combat simulation can achieve is to suspend your disbelief for moments or stretches of time and to actually convince you in those instants that you're piloting some sort of incredible military machine. Activision's MechWarrior 2 achieved this feat back in 1995. It was one of the pioneers of high-resolution 3D graphics, and beyond that, it was an excellent futuristic combat simulation. Since the MechWarrior series is, for better or for worse, confined to the rules of its source material, FASA's pen-and-paper tactical combat game, the real goal of Zipper Interactive's game is to update its predecessor with state-of-the-art graphics while retaining the action and simulation elements intact. And MechWarrior 3 accomplishes this goal gracefully, even as it tactfully deviates from certain traditions laid down by its ancestors to enhance the depth and complexity of the game. It might seem rough around the edges once in a while, but nevertheless, MechWarrior 3 is a worthy successor to one of the best games of the decade. Of course graphics aren't everything, but it doesn't hurt when a game looks as good as this. The attention to detail is what's especially impressive - although all the different mechs in the game look great, it's the way they move that makes them seem so real. You can see their toes flex, and they leave tracks in the earth and kick up clouds of dust and dirt with each and every step. They topple over slowly and painfully if they lose balance from a powerful attack, and struggle back to a standing position. As they're shot apart in battle, their limbs don't just fall off but rather rip from their sockets, leaving exposed pipes and cables where the arm or leg used to be. Their weapons fire independently and look powerful and are easily distinguishable on the battlefield. Laser weapons pierce their target instantly, while pulse lasers generate a steady stream of concentrated energy. Autocannons are so powerful that your mech recoils as it lets loose each hail of bullets, while your missiles fill the screen with their contrails. Certainly lasers, machine guns, and missiles aren't anything unusual for a science-fiction game, but in MechWarrior 3, these archetypal weapons are in top form, not only because they look great, but also because they are finely balanced with proportional strengths and weaknesses. As they fight, the BattleMechs look right at home in the beautiful, desolate terrain of the aptly named planet Tranquil. Though the hills might look a little blocky sometimes, everything else, like thunderstorms, beaches, ravines, and deserted cityscapes, looks realistic and detailed. You can even see rays of sunlight pierce through the overcast sky, while explosive weapons leave huge craters in the ground. Other special effects, like the fires caused by internal explosions in damaged mechs, as well as the deadly blue swirl of the particle projection cannon, look as good as just about everything else in the game. All the while, the 3D cockpit shudders with every step and every shot. MechWarrior 3's great sound effects make the game feel even more true to life, as each step is accompanied by a resounding, dull thud that perfectly conveys the awesome scale of the machine under your control. Weapons and explosions also sound good, although most of the speech in the game, including your onboard computer and assorted banter between rival MechWarriors, isn't anything especially exciting. The game's soundtrack, while suitably grandiose and serious-sounding, is also a bit of a disappointment after MechWarrior 2 and comes across as a pale imitation of its predecessor's striking orchestral score. But you won't be worried about the music once you're in the game, trying to fend off enemy mechs as well as tanks and stationary defenses. MechWarrior 3 plays similarly to its predecessor by forcing you to compensate for your machine's sluggishness with precision piloting and for its propensity to overheat with deadly aim. Mechs can twist at the torso, but you can also aim and fire easily at any point onscreen by using the mouse. One important new feature lets you magnify the area around your targeting reticle, so that you can strike a target from a much longer range than your eyes can see. Another new trick that works along with this one lets you lock onto specific parts of the enemy mech, so that you can try to disable key weapons systems or internal components. But pinpoint accuracy isn't quite so important if you decide to use an alpha strike, which unloads every weapon on your mech simultaneously. This devastating attack will overheat your mech more often than not, and overheating causes your sensors to malfunction and may cause your mech to shut down or even explode. But fortunately for you, MechWarrior 3 also introduces a coolant flush device that can be used a limited number of times to rapidly dissipate your machine's heat. Together, these abilities make MechWarrior 3 battles tense and exciting, since a quick decision can just as quickly determine the outcome. Most missions also put you in charge of a trio of vehicles that form your mobile field base, which is essentially a pit crew that can be ordered to reload and repair your mech on the battlefield. Although the MFB will try to stay out of the action, it can be destroyed if you aren't careful. So while the MFB is your lifeline, even as it renders the especially powerful BattleTech weapons (which hold very little ammunition) far more practical, it's also an all-new liability. Luckily, you usually won't have to fight alone and can order your lancemates to protect the MFB at the touch of a button. Communicating with your team is simple, and friendly pilots do a good job following orders, even as enemy pilots do a good job trying to put an end to you and your allies alike. Enemy mechs maneuver effectively, changing directions often and dodging and weaving to avoid your attacks, and their aim is good but not so perfect that you can't get away from their guns with some fancy footwork of your own. But being quick on your feet won't keep you alive for long, especially if you're up against several enemies at once, as they'll try to take advantage of their superior numbers by flanking and surrounding you. It's too bad, then, that the campaign is a little too straightforward and short for its own good, with only around 20 missions. Though they're linked seamlessly, the missions aren't terribly unique either, and in light of how good the game looks otherwise, it's disappointing that the campaign wasn't quite as bold or impressive as most everything else about MechWarrior 3. You'll probably end up spending a lot of time in the excellent instant-action mode instead, which you can use to easily set up fights against any number of enemies of any size and strength. You can even choose to fight wave after wave or progressively more challenging opponents, as well as pit yourself in base-attack and base-defense missions. Multiplayer MechWarrior 3 is similarly flexible and allows for both deathmatch and team-play battles, with plenty of opponents guaranteed on Microsoft's Gaming Zone. You could nitpick about how MechWarrior 3's mech lab interface is a little convoluted, making it cumbersome to customize your machine; and it's true that the campaign isn't quite as exciting as it might have been. Long-time fans will also lament the absence of some of the most interesting mech chassis types, like the marauder and the rifleman, which have been quietly discontinued because of legal concerns surrounding BattleTech's borrowing too much from the Japanese animation that inspired it. But these concerns aren't so very important once you find that MechWarrior 3 looks, sounds, and controls better than anything else like it. <I>--Greg Kasavin </I><br>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

510,Magic the Gathering: Duels of the Planewalkers - PC,"['As the television ads for the card-based version of Magic: The Gathering proclaim, ""All you need is a brain, a deck, and a friend."" Until the release of the multiplayer ManaLink patch in early February, MicroProse had provided plenty of decks but didn\'t allow players to compete against human opponents. Fans of the series were beginning to think the designers at MicroProse were the ones lacking brains. Duels of the Planeswalkers, the latest installment in MicroProse\'s Magic series, combines ManaLink, over 480 cards, and the Magic game engine - but the original release of Magic: The Gathering for the PC was over a year ago, and fans may find this add-on to be too little, too late. <P> In giving credit where credit is due, Duels is not solely an expansion pack. All of the elements found in the original Magic package can be found in Duels: 403 cards from the Fourth Edition set, two modes of gameplay (duel and campaign), a video-enhanced tutorial, faithful card art reproduction, and a plethora of pre-built decks. Duels even includes several interface enhancements and tournament options  la Spells of the Ancients, as well as 80 new cards from Legends and The Dark sets. <P> All of this makes Duels more of a rerelease than an add-on, but those of you who bought Magic when it hit the streets may be a bit peeved at MicroProse. Duels is the product that should have been released last year: a full-featured Magic engine that allows mano-a-mano duels via the Internet. Even if you own Magic and Spells of the Ancients and you only want the 80 new cards to enhance your decks (ManaLink is available to registered users for free via the Internet), you have to shell out another $30 for Duels ($45 street price with a $15 rebate). This means that dedicated players who have been with the series since the beginning will have to pay approximately $120 to play multiplayer Magic via the Internet with all of the available cards, giving way to the real magic behind both the card and computer-based version of Magic: its ability to mysteriously suck money from your pocket. <P> Duels is definitely aimed at newbies to Magic and, as a stand-alone product, it\'s a damn fine translation of the card game. However, for players who have been behind MicroProse\'s Magic from the beginning, Duels is almost useless and really just serves to piss you off. If you\'re new to Magic and are interested in the possibility of playing against your friends over the Internet or via a LAN, modem, or direct connection, you may want to check out Duels. But for you old-school Magic players out there, Duels of the Planeswalkers is simply not worth the price. <i>--Tal Blevins</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

511,Magic: The Gathering - Spells of the Ancients,"['Return to an age when the masters of the game dueled with legendary cards, such as the Juz&aacute;m Djinn and the Juggernaut. Double the challenge with on-the-spot deck construction in a sealed-deck tournament. The game features cards from the <I>Unlimited, Arabian Nights,</I> and <I>Antiquities</I> sets.', 'Players of the computerized Magic: The Gathering have been waiting for this. MicroProse has finally released Spells of the Ancients, the first expansion set for Magic, and it\'s a top-notch add-on that every MtG player should own. <P> The most obvious addition is the 138 new cards, culled from the Unlimited, Arabian Nights, and Antiquities sets. These are the earliest published sets of the Magic card game, and contain some very rare cards. MicroProse has also included six promotional cards that are among the rarest of all Magic cards ever printed. Cards from these early expansion sets are some of the most powerful around and can quickly boost the force of your deck.  <P> While some developers would consider this alone enough for an expansion pack, MicroProse goes even further - using the add-on to give Magic a much-needed facelift. Spells of the Ancients upgrades Magic: The Gathering to version 2.0 and fixes several of the problems found in the original. SotA revamps the clunky interface, improving aesthetics as well as usability and simplicity. There is also a ""Face Builder"" utility that allows you to create your own persona. Sounds like a neat idea, but it actually boils down to flipping through tons of clip art, which does little but change color. Perhaps the coolest new feature is the addition of sealed-deck tournament play. In the sealed-deck tournament, you must build a deck from unopened Starter Decks and Booster Packs chosen from the various sets. You can then challenge up to thirty-one other AI players using your new deck.  <P> The game itself hasn\'t changed, but several improvements have been added to improve gameplay. Version 2.0 is much more stable than previous versions and I suffered no crashes. It is also easier to avoid combat in the wilderness, making the campaign mode much less tedious. MicroProse has even updated the computer AI, and your computer opponents rarely make obvious flubs. <P> Even with all of these additions, MicroProse still has not included multiplay ability in this new upgrade package. However, a ManaLink coupon that promises multiplay action over the Internet is included with the game. When ManaLink becomes available (which should be sometime in November), MicroProse will send registered purchasers of SotA the first copies via electronic transfer. <P> With a price tag of around thirty bucks, Spells of the Ancients is an expansion pack that promises a lot of power for a moderate price. New cards, improved features, and sealed-deck tournaments should keep Magic: The Gathering fans busy for a while - and after ManaLink is released, perhaps eternity. <i>--Tal Blevins</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

There's something for everyone--action puzzles, music puzzles, word puzzles, and visual puzzles. With great graphics, sound, and 3-D animation, it takes the already popular series to a new level."", 'Smart Games are for smart people. There\'s no way around it. Whether playing these games will actually make you smarter overall or just smarter at playing these games is up for debate. Now, I really like packages of desktop puzzles because I can take a quick break from my adventure-game-like job and sharpen my brain from the well-chewed stub it is. While Smart Games 3 offers a wide assortment of puzzles, many of them are Mensa-only mind benders. <P> Like many other desktop puzzle collections, you\'re presented with a menu of different games, 20 in this case. These games range from seemingly simple pattern-recognition games to math games to word games and even a trivia game. In one game, you try to seat passengers on an airplane by applying different rules to different groups of people. For example, Masons must sit in the same row as Lions, and Shriners must sit in even-numbered rows. The trick is getting all the passengers seated without violating any rules. Another game uses the familiar rock-paper-scissors theme. You eliminate items until every item is gone except one. Extra points are awarded if you can place a specific item in a specific square as your last move. Yet another game has you match up groups of butterflies based on wing pattern and shape, eliminated three, four, and five at a time. In this game, you get points for clearing the board as well as matching up patterns and wing shape. <P> You can probably tell that the games I liked the best had to do with recognizing and memorizing patterns. Some of my other colleagues preferred the math-oriented games (which I cannot do at all, much to my chagrin) and the word-oriented games (which I liked, but not as well as the pattern-recognition games). The only game that seems out of place in this collection is the trivia game (Who, What, Where, When), which rewards knowledge, not intelligence. <P> The first level of every puzzle is ridiculously simple. This makes for a nice, confidence-boosting start. Even I could get through the first level of Tumblin\' Dice (a tricky math puzzle). However, the puzzles quickly increase in difficulty. It\'s rather like wading into the ocean up to your knees and having the sand suddenly drop away, leaving only the trackless depths below and the raging waters in front of you. I would have been more willing to play more games if the learning curve hadn\'t been quite so unforgiving. <P> While many of the 20 games had simple instructions, making play relatively intuitive, many had such complex instructions and counterintuitive keyboard commands, I simply gave up trying to make that stupid Lego-like brick snap into place and went back to seating the Shriners next to the Masons. No doubt these more-complicated games are a good brain tease, I just feel that desktop puzzles should be easy to learn and difficult to master. I don\'t want to spend half an hour just figuring out how to play. If I want that kind of torture, I\'ll fire up the Starcraft tutorial again. <P> One thing Smart Games 3 gives you is lots and lots of puzzles. Each of the 20 puzzles has at least 30 levels (one has 100), giving you more than 600 levels to play (yes, I used my calculator to figure that one out). In addition, if you get bored, you can download puzzle packs from the [<a href=""http://www.smartgames.com"">]Smart Games web site[</a>] that contain new levels for the Smart Games 3 games. In addition, you can join Smart Games leagues and compete in online contests. <P> So, on the one hand, I curse Smart Games 3 for telling me that my 33-year-old brain isn\'t as sharp as it was in its Stanford days. On the other hand, I just spent two hours getting rid of all the butterflies. If mind-bending addictive puzzles are your thing, you\'ll love Smart Games 3. <i>--Nicole Freeman</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Along the way, you\'ll find challenging puzzles to solve and minimysteries to unlock. This is a totally engaging mystery adventure that is sure to keep supersleuths entertained--from the opening scene to the exciting cliffhanging climax.', ""In the right hands, the Clue franchise should translate into a fun, engaging computer adventure. The original board game is a campy send-up of the genteel whodunit formula of Agatha Christie and Dorothy Sayers. It has stuffy Brits with silly names like Colonel Mustard and Professor Plum. The setting is a lush '30s-style mansion containing an arsenal of lethal knickknacks like a dagger, a wrench, and a noose. And the game's mildly subversive subtext seems to be that any one of the elite, cultured cast could be a murderer. <P> Don't expect any of the board game's promising elements to get much play in Clue Chronicles: Fatal Illusion, which is the first episode in a lower-priced series of introductory adventure mysteries from Hasbro Interactive. The game's execution is as boring as its characters. You are a private investigator who has been invited to a New Year's 1939 party by the dotty millionaire Ian Masque. En route to his creepy mansion aboard a yacht, you and the other invitees witness Masque's apparent murder by a booby-trapped artifact. The game's afoot. You do the usual adventuring thing - gather objects, question the other guests, and solve a series of familiar mechanical puzzles (crack a combination lock, find the missing gears, etc.). Once at the mansion itself, you help each of the other characters resolve riddles Masque has left behind and so gather together a series of missing jewels. <P> All of the game mechanics are competent and pitched to a novice adventurer, as are the straightforward puzzle solutions. From a first-person view, you move from point to point through prerendered period sets, questioning each guest via a pop-up memo pad of subjects. The scenery design is sparse, and the cutscenes lack any cinematic flair. An inventory of gathered objects also glides up from below. A visual catalog of suspects offers a bit of background and reminds you of each guest's possible motive in offing Ian Masque. The hint system is especially good, in that it lets you access up to three hints of decreasing obscurity at a given juncture in the game. At the very least, Fatal Illusion serves as a fair introduction to the adventure/puzzle style of play. <P> Unfortunately, the game never goes beyond the very least it can do. At heart, it doesn't seem to understand the art of the whodunit. The mystery genre is all about character and motive, hidden desire, and personal secrets, which turn out to be the least compelling parts of the game. The usual suspects are here: a swarthy magician, a playboy, a pair of femmes fatales, a society matron, et. al. But the scripting, voice acting and graphics of the characters are all as wooden as an oak. Interviewing these stiffs is like trying to converse with exhibits at a wax museum. Their background stories are too shallow to be engaging, and they generally spend a lot of time pointing fingers at one another. How could a scriptwriter not have a little fun with the likes of Colonel Mustard or Professor Plumb? Worse yet, the game really isn't about deduction at all. Solving a series of mechanical puzzles rather than unraveling the riddle of human motivation or eliminating suspects advances the action. And the puzzles themselves are rudimentary - you just piece together a half dozen pieces of torn instructions or jiggle a few switches until the thingamabob powers up for you. <P> In fairness to the game's meager ambitions, Fatal Illusion is priced for and pitched to the very casual gaming crowd. If you've played more than one or two adventure games in your time, the difficulty and brevity of Fatal Illusion will be disappointing, as it takes less than six hours to win for even an average player. When it hits the $15 bargain bin (next week sometime), it will make a fair gift for mom and dad or perhaps the neighbors, who just got their first PC. The initial mystery - Who poisoned Ian Masque's puzzle box? - and its surprise conclusion make the game a mild diversion, even if the rest of the journey feels decidedly unmysterious. Nevertheless, and to their credit, the designers integrate the puzzles into the setting and plot more effectively than some more ambitious adventures. <P> But even as an introductory adventure game, Fatal Illusion will make most gamers wince because of its low production values and unimaginative design. Games like it should be putting more effort into weaving an engaging story by adding some suspense and complex characters to the puzzles, because those are the dramatic criteria most new gamers bring to the experience from other areas of entertainment. The real mystery behind Fatal Illusion is why the designers didn't let themselves have more fun with the opportunity to make a Clue game. Why reduce such promising characters into Colonel Bland and Professor Pallid? Why not bring the deduction-oriented gameplay of the board game somehow into the adventure? Whodunit? The real question is whoblewit? <BR>--<I>Steve Smith</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;2000 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Single or multi-player - mew missions let you fly for the Empire or the Rebellion, alone or with others, cooperatively or competitively. Includes authentic film score, realistic sound effects and full motin cinematic framing sequences.', 'Very few gamers were entirely satisfied with X-Wing vs. Tie Fighter when it was originally released last summer. In fact, to many gamers, it was both one of the most eagerly anticipated and ultimately one of the most disappointing games of 1997. Critics noted the lack of support for 3D accelerator cards; the omission of several of the more powerful fighters from past games in the series, such as the B-Wing and TIE Defender; the cartoonish cockpit graphics; and the visually disproportionate size of the apparently puny Imperial Star Destroyers. But the most frequently expressed complaint of disgruntled purchasers was that Totally Games and LucasArts, by concentrating almost exclusively on providing a multiplayer dogfighting arena, had abandoned the storyline-driven gameplay of previous games in the series. X-Wing vs. Tie Fighter provided no storyline, no campaigns, no dramatic cutscenes, and overall, a poor single-player experience. Fortunately, Balance of Power does an admirable job of addressing almost all the complaints gamers had with the original game. <P> Balance of Power includes two separate 15-mission campaigns - one for the Imperial forces and one for the Rebel forces. In the Rebel missions you\'ll be on the defensive from the outset, scrambling to regroup your forces in order to fend off, and ultimately destroy, a large Imperial fleet equipped with a gigantic Super Star Destroyer. Ye of little faith who thought LucasArts could never properly depict the size of a massive ship like the Super Star Destroyer will be suitably humbled the first time you lay your eyes on this beast. Although an epic ""attack the Death Star"" mission is still missing, challenging the city-sized Super Star Destroyer provides an apt substitute. The Imperial campaign involves chasing down the Rebels and preventing them from establishing a new Starship Shipyard. Every time you manage to complete five missions in a campaign, you are rewarded with a well-produced cutscene (six in total) that advances the campaign storyline in a compelling manner (and in the largely nameless/faceless X-Wing vs. Tie Fighter universe, which usually means a computer-generated sequence with a lot of ships blowing up). Best of all, the campaigns can be played through by a group of players as cooperative multiplayer missions. After you complete a campaign mission, you can replay it as a training mission. <P> The missions in the campaigns are refreshingly varied in their objectives and design and are, paradoxically, both the best addition to X-Wing vs. Tie Fighter and the cause of the most frustration. A number of the campaign missions are extremely difficult for a single player to successfully complete on the default difficulty level. Since tasks (which are occasionally unintuitive) often have to be carried out in a particular sequence, too many of the missions end up feeling puzzle-like, requiring you to figure out exactly where you have to go at different stages of the mission in order to be successful. Anyone familiar with Lawrence Holland\'s other games, Like X-Wing, Tie Fighter, and Secret Weapons of the Luftwaffe won\'t be surprised by the occasionally devilishly challenging mission. But it\'s ironic that the campaigns in Balance of Power were arguably included to provide a better single-player experience, and yet they are extremely difficult for a single player to complete on the default difficulty level. Fortunately there are easier skill levels for frustrated gamers to meekly resort to and even a harder one for gamers who are ""one with the force."" You can also play each mission from the perspective of different flight groups, which enhances replayability by giving you different (often more challenging) mission objectives, and gives you additional opportunities to experiment with the Rebel B-Wing fighter (which is usually not your default choice). <P> For an affordably priced expansion pack, Balance of Power provides outstanding value. In addition to the campaigns and cutscenes, Balance of Power also adds eight new separate ""combat engagements"" (single missions to accomplish specified objectives), one new ""battle"" in which you can link the combat engagements together, and two melees (free-for-all shoot-em-ups). While the only new ship available to you is the Rebel B-Wing fighter, Balance of Power also adds five new capital ships (including the formidable Super Star Destroyer), two new starship bases, and a new gun emplacement platform. Although a 3D patch for X-Wing vs. Tie Fighter was made available some time ago, Balance of Power does automatically add the latest version of the patch and cleans up a few textures. You can now program your own ""taunts"" to gleefully mock your hapless foes. Finally, Balance of Power adds the familiar ""white streaks of light"" hyperspace effect, which was notably absent from the original game. Gamers who have been disappointed by uninspired expansion packs that haphazardly slap together a bunch of single-player missions, throw in a couple of new multiplayer arenas and a handful of units, and call it a day, will be pleasantly surprised with Balance of Power. Balance of Power provides more gameplay than most full games. The only things missing are new sound effects and (Star Wars-fan sacrilege alert!) new music. Don\'t get me wrong - I love John William\'s Star Wars music as much as the next guy, but hasn\'t LucasArts milked the Star Wars theme songs enough? Keep the classic music (what Star Wars game would be complete without the Imperial March), but let\'s have a few new chords next time. <P> Minor complaints aside, Totally Games and LucasArts have finally delivered the game that was so anxiously anticipated prior to X-Wing vs. Tie Fighter\'s release. Balance of Power perhaps arrives a little late, but it is certainly successful in making X-Wing vs. Tie Fighter one of the best games to be released in 1997 - and is still the only multiplayer space sim worth its weight in Jawas. <i>--Desslock</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

568,USAF - PC,"[""Climb the pyramid to be the top pilot of the most advanced air force in the world: the USAF. Fly and train over U.S. soil in the F-16C Falcon and A-10 Warthog or an arsenal of six other planes. Then relive great historic air battles flying the rugged F-4E over Vietnam or the powerful F-15C in Operation Desert Storm. Finally, push the envelope flying the menacing F-117 Stealth Fighter and ultramodern F-22 Raptor as you project the power of the United States in futuristic campaigns over Europe. If that's not enough, take your skills to the Internet, flying against other aces on JanesCombat.Net."", ""A straight line runs from Chuck Yeager's Air Combat, one of the most revered and influential PC flight sims, to Jane's new survey sim USAF. The Jane's tradition of accessible flight simulations with plenty of planes and options has given us Air Combat, US Navy Fighters, Advanced Tactical Fighters, and Israeli Air Force, with steady improvement and little deviation from the formula. USAF is no exception, but is poised to take the survey sim into new territory. <P> The appeal of this sort of simulation is because of several factors: It has a lot of planes, numerous gameplay options, and moderate realism levels. Together these three elements create a package that gives the more casual fan a taste of air combat without the burden of too much detail. Hard-core simulation fans often shun such games for these same reasons, because the generic controls and lack of extreme realism or detail seem too far removed from the real-world complexities of in-depth sims like Flanker 2.0 and Falcon. <P> There's no question that USAF falls in the midrange on the realism scale. With eight flyable planes, you can't expect the refined flight model and sophisticated avionics of a stand-alone simulation. But for this trade-off you get those eight planes, each with unique cockpits and distinct, if not precise, flight models. To simplify things, controls are shared among the eight planes, so that the F-117 uses the same radar functions as the F-16, and so on. <P> USAF pushes the envelope by taking on several generations of air combat. Planes and missions come from Vietnam, the Gulf War, and the near future, creating a broad canvas of action rarely seen in a flight sim. You can fly in the F-15, F-16, F-22, F-117, F4, MiG 29, F-105, and A-10, plus some variations on these. This diversity serves as a sort of history lesson on the development of jet combat, as you go from the fast gunfights and rudimentary radar of the F-105 and F4 to the hi-tech stealth precision of the F-22. All three eras (past, present, and future) are ably served by full-blown campaigns illustrating the many roles of air combat. The four campaigns include a present-day training situation, Vietnam, the Gulf War, and a hypothetical near-future European conflict. Campaigns are semidynamic, meaning the missions are scripted with some randomization, and resources are tracked throughout the course of the campaign. If you use missiles and lose airframes carelessly, you'll probably find yourself short on funds later in the campaign. It's not the true dynamic battlefield found in the likes of Longbow and Falcon, but the missions are tight and the campaigns are satisfying. <P> The rest of the play options feature the stunning array of game types that are the trademark of the Jane's line. You can create almost any encounter you want with a quick mission option. Air-to-air and strike missions can be configured to pit any aircraft or group against any other in any situation, altitude, and position of advantage. Want to try a wing of Phantoms against a single Strike Eagle? It will take you about a minute. You can also simply start a random quick mission that will choose all these settings for you. Scripted stand-alone missions take on specific historical encounters and elaborate hypothetical scenarios that cover the entire range of air combat. USAF is playable online via Jane's Combat.net matching service, and will also form the core of the forthcoming Jane's World War: a massively multiplayer persistent-world air-combat arena. It will be your first point of entry to this ambitious project, but the beta and final launch dates of Jane's World War are uncertain as of this time. <P> Visually, USAF is inconsistent. The detail on the planes and objects is good, and while terrain looks decent from high altitudes, you'll see some real problems with it once you get down low. The landscape textures have visible seams. There's also an odd kind of texture pop-in as the terrain visibly smoothes during flight. Even the trees and bushes look funny: small, blinking, and quite distracting. Frame rates are adequate on a high-powered system, but the terrain problems in Pixel's Israeli Air Force persist in this newer simulation. In high-altitude aircraft this isn't a problem, but with the mud runs of the A-10 and F15, it becomes more of an issue. <P> Graphical flaws aside, USAF continues a revered tradition of accessible and diverse Jane's flight simulations. There are more missions and planes in this one package than in a dozen other recent sims, and its diverse features and the important place USAF will have in Jane's World War will keep it flying for a long, long time to come. <I>--Tony Lopez</I> <P> --<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

574,Starsiege Tribes (Jewel Case) - PC,"['This first-person perspective game sets tribe against tribe. Although single players can train and practice alone, the real heart of this game is its multiplayer design. This focus on working as a member of a tribe, together with dynamic graphics and seamless integration between exteriors and interiors, make this game unique.', ""Any time a game is designed strictly for online play, that game's developer is taking a serious risk when bringing the game to market. After all, there are still plenty of gamers who prefer single-player titles. So in order for a multiplayer-only title to be successful, it must provide that elegant combination of great gameplay, painless online connectivity, and speedy performance to ensure its popularity and success. Starsiege: Tribes from Dynamix and Sierra comes awfully close to striking that perfect balance, and, although performance can be a problem, the game manages to provide one of the more memorable and addictive online gaming experiences yet."", ""Set in the universe formerly known as EarthSiege, Tribes is a first-person, squad-based action game in which you take part in team battles against one or more rival clans. Game variants include the obligatory deathmatch mode, along with capture the flag and a slew of other challenging game types: Defend and destroy requires you to guard your base while taking out your enemy's, capture and hold is like CTF except that you must grab and defend specific spots on the map, and find and retrieve is basically a big scavenger hunt with heavy weapons."", ""Gameplay is very similar to multiplayer mode in NovaLogic's Delta Force but with far better visuals and many more options for customizing your weapons loadout. The game features nearly 40 maps, each of which is a wonderfully rendered landscape with rolling hills and plenty of big, open spaces. As in Delta Force, a great deal of combat takes place at extreme ranges, but thanks to the superb 3D graphics engine, you can more easily make out your targets in Tribes."", 'You have the choice of light, medium, or heavy armor, each of which can accommodate a varying set of weapons and equipment. Players in heavy armor, for example, are the only ones who can carry heavy mortars (which are incredibly powerful and good for taking out base defenses from afar). Light-armored players, on the other hand, are the only ones capable of wielding the deadly (and oh so wonderful) sniper rifle in combat.', 'The weapons in Tribes are decent, with a few energy weapons, a slick gun the fires explosive discs, a short-range Gatling gun, and a trusty grenade launcher. The sniper rifle is the only ""instant effect"" gun in the bunch, as each of the other weapons fires a relatively slow projectile. This can make the game\'s long-distance combat rather difficult, as you must aim very carefully and learn to anticipate your target\'s moves - jumping madly into a free-for-all Quake II-style fray is usually a recipe for disaster in Tribes.', ""You can also carry a variety of other equipment, such as gun turrets, which are typically set up to automatically defend your base and your flag, and repair kits, which are always helpful for fixing damaged consoles and energy stations. Different types of consoles allow you to change your armor and weapons configurations, get a quick reload, or summon up a transport aircraft to fly. Like the armor variants, there are three types of aircraft in Tribes: scout, medium, and heavy. The larger craft can carry other players, making them useful for long-range mass attacks. The single-player scout craft, on the other hand, is quite speedy and has the ability to fire explosive rockets. Energy stations keep the aircraft and other types of consoles operational and are the key to survival in Tribes - take out an enemy's energy source, and they will be hard-pressed to mount a viable defense."", 'Once you\'re connected to a server, your results will most certainly vary. I rarely encountered any significant lag at any ""green"" server I joined, but the chat line in every game I played was littered with lag complaints from other players. I saw many players get stuck and drop from the game entirely, as well. On only one server did I have any lockups or dropped connections, and there it seemed to be a problem with that specific server\'s stability.', ""Playing Tribes can be pretty intimidating at first, as the game's meager single-player training missions do little to prepare you for the online carnage of a multiplayer battle. Also, despite the game's team structure, there are still plenty of freelancers in each game, running about with their own agenda and little regard for teamwork or joint objectives. And when a loose group of freelance hotshots runs into a well-organized team, the results are always the same: Complete and utter humiliation for the solo artists."", 'Tribes could stand to be improved in a few areas, notably in the matter of the weapons consoles. Currently, these stations almost always have long lines of players waiting for access. You can urge other players to hurry up with a prerecorded voice command, which rarely has any effect, or take advantage of the game\'s ""favorites"" feature to preset five custom weapons loadouts and speed up your own time at the weapons console. Perhaps if you could begin a mission - and respawn - with one of your favorite loadouts already in place, the console-glut problem would ease up a bit. You would then only have to visit the console for repairs and to change loadouts for a specific purpose (such as picking up a turret for deployment).', ""Also, the game could really benefit from more and better training missions. Firing each gun a few times does little to teach the intricacies of aiming a mortar, for example. And the Terra Nova style keyboard command layout takes quite a bit of getting used to, especially when used in combination with the jetpack (for which the game offers little guidance). One way to handle this deficiency would be to include a skirmish mode, so that you could at least get in a little practice before running smack into a team of seasoned veterans online. You can learn quickly in a multiplayer game, but you can also get wiped out repeatedly without ever getting the chance to see or learn from your opponent - and that's not going to keep new players coming back."", ""Finally, the game really needs to handle scores and statistics a little better. After a mission is completed, you get about ten seconds to call up the scores and see how you and your team fared. Unfortunately, the score window is too small and offers too little information - which is gone in a few seconds anyway, as the game automatically launches a new mission after the previous one is completed. First off, Tribes should present the stats in a larger, easier-to-read window. Secondly, Dynamix really should consider tracking assists or some similar stat. As it stands, the only player who gets credit for a kill is the one who gets in the final shot - never mind the sniper who took the bad guy down to 1-percent health to begin with. Lastly, why not save a player's accumulated stats locally? Kills, games won, flags captured: It may be a team game, but I kind of like to know when I've killed my 100th victim online."", ""In light of the game's outstanding gameplay, however, each of these criticisms is a minor point at best. Looking at the game as a whole, there's no denying that Starsiege: Tribes is an ambitious game that successfully delivers a rich and addictive multiplayer gaming experience. Any team-minded action fan will love this game, and I suspect that more than a few freelance types will also."", ""[Editor's Note: In the original version of this review, it was stated that specific ping values for Tribes servers were not provided.

576,FIFA 2000 - PC,"['Soccer has never been very popular in the United States, if only because its 45-minute halves of continuous action are unlike the frequent start-stop dynamic of pro football, baseball, and basketball. Throw in the typically low score of a soccer match, and it isn\'t difficult to understand the general lack of interest in the game. That being the case, computer and video soccer games have traditionally been designed for foreign markets and later released in the US in hopes of making some additional sales. But EA Sports changed all that with FIFA for the Sega Genesis console, which proved to be successful both in Europe and the United States, and started one of EA Sports\' most important brands. And judging by FIFA 2000, this high-quality soccer franchise is still going strong. <P> FIFA 2000 adds the 12 teams of the MLS to the existing roster of countless other leagues from around the world. Now you too can fulfill the soccer matchup urologist\'s dream of pitting the Kansas City Wiz against the Dallas Burn. The game\'s strange opening sequence of old-time players meeting the new cyber soccer athlete can be forgiven thanks to a great soundtrack that includes UK musician Robbie Williams\' hit It\'s Only Us. <P> Get past the intro and you\'ll find there are four basic modes in FIFA 2000: exhibition, tournament, season, and training. It also contains three levels of play: amateur, pro, and world class. There is a big difference in the computer\'s skill level between the three settings, most noticeably in the speed of the opposing players. Great weaving runs will win matches for you in the amateur level but will become obsolete at the pro level in which short, crisp passing becomes the order of the day. The training area is a good place to try to adjust to the different speed of the players at the higher levels. In addition, you can practice various set pieces, such as penalty kicks, throw-ins, and free kicks. <P> Exhibition mode lets you match one team against another, and with teams available from such soccer-loving countries as England, Scotland, Germany, and Italy, plus classic teams from the past and a large number of international squads, the exhibition mode is almost a game in and of itself. However, the tournament mode offers more variety. Single-elimination tournaments are rare in US sports, and yet they generate huge excitement throughout the rest of the world. FIFA 2000\'s tournament mode lets you make a custom single-elimination tournament of the teams you want. I particularly enjoyed matching up the lesser English Premiership teams with teams from Scotland and Major League Soccer. But different combinations of teams from any of the available leagues can be put together. In addition, there is a custom league option that allows complete mixing and matching. For example, I took the teams from Scotland and Sweden and put them in a 22-team league, but I was disappointed that the game ended after one season. <P> The regular season mode lets you take a single team through the entire season of competition. For instance, if you\'re playing a great team from England, then you play not only league games, but also domestic and European cup competitions. Of further note, FIFA 2000 includes various classic teams, such as the 1968 Manchester United European Cup winners and the brilliant early-\'70s Ajax squad. EA made a curious aesthetic decision to use a brown-colored tint when two of the old-time teams play, as if to re-create the look of a grainy old film reel. But this effect merely interferes with the gameplay - specifically the appearance of the pass direction arrow, which is in all other cases unobtrusively color-coded - and it should have been an option rather than the default. <P> Once you get into the game, it\'s high-octane sports action at its finest. The motion-captured animation is superb overall and completely captures the essence of movement in soccer. Great crowd animations and stadium chants also add to the atmosphere. The varied heights of the players, their realistic facial expressions, and even their hairstyles all make you believe you\'re actually watching your favorite team. <P> FIFA 2000 not only looks good, but it also plays well. For instance, the controls are very responsive. You can perform a variety of kicks, tackles, and headers with various button presses and combinations. As you move with the ball, the pass direction arrow clearly points toward offscreen players and indicates the chances of the ball getting through to them. However, EA Sports could have improved FIFA 2000\'s player-management and simulation aspects. While it is possible to move players between teams, there are no filters to prevent lopsided moves. Each team has a certain amount of money, so you can\'t buy all the players you want, although it is still possible to pick up an entire team of good players. It would be nice to see an active intelligent trade market and managers making deals based on need. FIFA 2000 lets you play up to three seasons in a league, but without this active trading there is really no point, since the same teams remain powerful. This may be why the customizable league stops after one season - but it would be nice to have active trading and leagues that could continue year after year. <P> EA Sports brought on MLS commentator Julie ""Rowdy"" Foudy of the United States Woman\'s World Cup team to provide the color commentary along with ESPN\'s Phil Schoen. While FIFA fans have become familiar with the commentary style of respected English commentator John Motson, Foudy is pleasant enough, although it is disorienting to hear her talk about tackles on a football field (meaning American football) within the context of a soccer game. <P> While there is some room for improvement, FIFA 2000 delivers on almost every front and is a fast-paced, enjoyable, and challenging soccer game with numerous options and lots of depth. Though you may find yourself wishing FIFA 2000 offered even more, it is ultimately a must for any soccer fan.<I>--Colin Sloan</I> <P> --<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

If you didn\'t come down with a severe case of the Black Death in those days, then your poor, starving, plague-ridden village was being ransacked by some neighboring tyrant. Sierra tries to capture the bleak reality of the bloody feudal struggles during these so-called ""dark ages"" in their recent turn-based/real-time strategy title Lords of the Realm II. Devout fans of strategy greats hoped that this would combine the best of both Warcraft II and Civilization II, and while it falls just short of being that ultimate game, Lords II still provides a challenging and entertaining experience for strategy enthusiasts. And challenging it is: The Middle Ages were tough times and similarly, Lords of the Realm II is a tough game.', 'The premise of Lords of the Realm II: The king has been axed, and you, along with other feudal lords, are vying to capture neighboring fiefdoms and gain rule over the land. The majority of the game takes place in a three-quarter perspective (like Civilization II), showing your village, surrounding industries (like mining, weapons production, woodcutting, and agriculture), and traders, who travel in and out of your territory periodically. The first part of a typical campaign is normally spent carefully managing agricultural resources and adjusting tax rates to foster more peasant growth and build up a decent economy. After a few seasons (each turn advances you a season) when industrial growth becomes more of a concern, you can simply adjust a slider that controls your farming vs. industry priority. This all sounds pretty straightforward in ink (or electrons, whatever), but your peasants are fairly temperamental. They get ticked off by things like slight tax increases, food shortages, over-conscripting, and being overworked. A ""happiness"" figure located on the toolbar indicates the status of your village, and if your villagers aren\'t feeling hunky-dory about the way you\'re governing, they\'ll revolt at the drop of a hat.', 'Once you have a decent number of (happy) peasants, you can start conscripting them to build up armies. Different soldier classes - peasants, knights, archers, pikemen, and mercenaries - all become available depending on the storehouse of weapons you possess. At some point, you have to deal with the other power-hungry lords. These guys are real cocky bastards, and their continual, snotty provocations just make you want to ""get medieval"" on them all the more. Guide your troops over to meet an opposing lord\'s army or allow him to try to attack a garrisoned castle, and the screen automatically switches to real-time combat mode. Music gets a little more dramatic and, as happens in Warcraft, you select troops, point and click on enemies, and the chain mail flies. If you\'re defending a castle, you can be really cruel, dumping sizzling oil on enemies and perforating them with arrows while they try to break through your castle walls with siege towers, catapults, and battering rams.', ""I'll have to admit, it's pretty exciting to defend a besieged castle. But on the whole, the real-time combat in Lords of the Realm II could have been improved greatly. Your men are frustratingly difficult to maneuver, stumbling around at times as though they'd just had a frontal lobotomy. Also, just like a field of pre-adolescent soccer players, the combat field gets a little too crowded too easily."", ""Although the economic model of Lords I has been simplified to incorporate these action elements, it still adds a new spin to and makes more challenging a title which, for the most part, would have just been a resource management game. Some die-hard war strategy gamers may find that the new style of Lords II is too compromising and that the game spreads itself thin by trying to accomplish too much. But if you're looking for a new Civ-style strategy game that adds a new dimension to its gameplay, you may want to give Lords of the Realm II a try. <i>--Tim Soete</i> <br />--<i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc.

585,Sierra Sports Viper Racing - PC,"[""This car racing simulator features the Dodge Viper modeled in exquisite detail. The game is easy to master yet lets experienced racers work their way up through the racing leagues. It also offers the option to customize your car using the paint kit and upgrade your car's components in the garage."", 'Newcomer Monster Games came up with an interesting concept for Viper Racing: Create the type of ultrarealistic physics model found in games like Grand Prix Legends and use it to simulate racing a high-dollar production car. It might not sound that groundbreaking, but with the exception of 1993\'s Car and Driver, it\'s probably the only game featuring a car like the Dodge Viper that isn\'t 95 percent arcade action and 5 percent realistic racing. <P> So if the box art of a Viper tearing down a speedway led you to believe you were getting a beefed-up Need for Speed III or Test Drive 5, you\'re in for a big surprise. The Viper\'s the only authentic car featured here; the other choices are generic rides called ""sport,"" ""sedan,"" and ""exotic,"" along with a plane tossed in for the hell of it. The graphics work for the cars doesn\'t come close to what you find in Test Drive 5, and the scenery and terrain are merely average compared with the gorgeous background visuals of Need for Speed III. And even when you play the game in arcade mode, you\'ll discover the physics model is considerably more demanding than in pure arcade racers. <P> But it\'s a whole other story if you head into Viper Racing expecting a highly detailed, realistic simulation of one of the world\'s most powerful and alluring automobiles. Though Viper Racing\'s pleasures (perhaps ""rewards"" is a better word) aren\'t discovered quickly or cheaply, some patience and practice will reveal a pulse-quickening game that feels so real at times that knuckles whiten and teeth grind. <P> What makes Viper Racing so immersive is the physics model MGI created for the game. At first, it might seem a little too realistic, as you find yourself constantly fishtailing out of control, sliding off the track into a field, or even rocketing off a cliff. But when you realize what sort of car you\'re driving - a 3400-pound beast with an 8.0-litre V10 capable of generating 450hp - and remember that you can\'t sling it around like a Formula One Racer, you\'ll find yourself staying on the track and gradually becoming more competitive with the aggressive computer-controlled cars. And I do mean aggressive: These guys\'ll bump you off the road and into a river or valley with the sort of precision you\'d expect to see at a Joey Chitwood show. <P> At about the same time, you\'ll also begin to notice just how real the driving experience seems, particularly if you\'ve got a force feedback wheel. As you head through curves, you can feel when you\'re about to lose traction completely and back off the gas to avoid disaster, and even heading down a straightaway you can sense the contours of the road. The sound effects, from engine noise to the squeal of skidding tires, are very good and add subtly yet effectively to the overall driving ambience. Even if you turned the sound off, though, the banging, bumping, and powersliding action is plenty good enough to make you think you\'re screaming down a stretch of highway at 165mph. <P> Quick races can be run against computer opponents, the clock, or your own best performance (""ghost car"") on any of the game\'s eight tracks and in any vehicle, and there are options to set the difficulty level of opponents and the physics model for the cars. Every setup feature in the garage - you can adjust camber, toe-in, bump, anti-roll bar, rebound, springs, ride height, brake bias, wheel lock, spoiler size, and gear ratios - is accessible in a quick race, making it a good way to get a general idea of how you should set up for each track once you start the career mode. <P> I say general idea because the career mode starts you out as an amateur, limiting your adjustments to brake bias and wheel lock. What this means is that how quickly you advance to the next level of competition depends on your driving, not your setup expertise. As you win races and start socking away prize money, you\'ll be able to add performance-enhancing accessories to improve your exhaust, shocks, axles, gearbox, tires - you name somewhere on the Viper you can slap a new part, and it\'s probably in this game. Choices are limited to your class, and by the time you get to GT Class the whole world of upgrades opens up to you. <P> But Viper Racing\'s low price and its lavish attention to modeling the Dodge Viper come at certain costs. Although the computer drivers are good, there are only seven to race against on eight tracks, and those tracks seem strangely barren and devoid of any signs of human life except for nondescript buildings (OK, the castle isn\'t nondescript). The Viper\'s the only car you can drive in career mode (I\'ve got no problem with that), and no matter which of the other cars you choose for a quick race, the other guys will be in - you guessed it - Dodge Vipers. <P> But those are shortcomings, not flaws; when it comes to actual complaints about what\'s in Viper Racing, the biggest one I can come up with is that the sensation of speed is... well, screwy. You know the message on rearview mirrors that says ""Objects are closer than they appear""? Viper Racing should have a similar warning, something like: ""You\'re always going faster than it appears."" As you slide out of control in a curve, you\'ll be wondering why it\'s happening when you\'re only going 60 or 70 - until a quick glance at the speedometer shows you\'re way over 100. This is a purely subjective gripe, of course, and after a while you\'ll undoubtedly develop an innate sense of how fast you\'re going in relation to the track. But it is something that might put impatient gamers off before they get a chance to discover how intense this game can be. <P> Viper Racing sports a full array of multiplayer options (modem, serial, LAN, and TCP/IP for Internet play), but just as with Grand Prix Legends, Sierra has tossed a potentially great multiplayer game on the market with zero support to help owners set up races. Serious racers will find a few Viper Racing leagues to join, but those of us looking for some quick racing without the commitment that goes along with league play are out of luck. Here\'s hoping Viper Racing makes it onto WON or the Internet Gaming Zone soon. <P> Probably the worst thing you can say about Viper Racing is that it\'s pretty limited in its scope - but you could just as easily turn that around and say that the developer focused on a few things so it could make sure they were all done very, very well. All I know is that it sure hooked me. <i>--Stephen Poole</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

It's all here from speed to stunts--if you can do it on a dirt bike, you can do it in Motorcross Madness."", ""Microsoft seems to be cornering the market on sports requiring that a perfectly good sports arena be filled with mud. First, it releases the surprisingly fun Monster Truck Madness series, and now it follows it up with this motocross simulator. Anyone who's ever seen a commercial for a Super Bowl of motocross will undoubtedly already have a pretty vivid image of the game in his mind: masked cyclists flying through the air at unbelievable heights, waving raised thumbs and legs at the wildly cheering audience, then landing (possibly in a heap) on the dirt track below. And that's pretty much what the game delivers. <P> Which is a compliment. With its multitude of modes and good terrain graphics, this is pretty much everything you could hope for in a motocross simulation, and then some. <P> Motocross Madness is really two games in one. Most of your options are for races - there are national races, supercross races, and the grueling Baja. The first two are typical multilap races in outdoor or indoor arenas. Though the game is by no means a serious sim, the races follow in the tradition of more realistic driving simulations. For instance, you really have little hope of doing well unless you've spent some time memorizing the various tracks. <P> The Baja races are very different. These marathons have you racing many laps through expansive outdoor environments - they aren't so much about speed as endurance. These are quite fun, as they take a great deal of time to complete, and the standings can change dramatically over the course of a single race. <P> In the race modes, understanding motorcycle mechanics comes in handy, as well, and you'll have to adjust shocks, engine, and gears if you want to hit peak performance in the different environments. And while Motocross Madness does provide preset values for these - as well as a number of assists - the only major problem with the game is that it doesn't give beginners any context or help in determining how to tweak the different elements. <P> But where the game really shines is in the stunt quarry. Each of the arenas for this mode is a series of sharp rises and valleys where you compete to successfully perform the most stunts in a predetermined period of time. This mode flaunts Motocross Madness' greatest feature: the excellent physics engine, which has just enough realism to make it believable and just enough exaggeration to make it fun. There's only one minor problem with this mode, which is that the stunts themselves are just a series of preset button combinations, and you gain more or fewer points depending on how long you hold them. It'd be great if there was room for a bit more freestyle action - but there's no denying the thrill of pulling off a few stunts in a single while you're careening through the air over the competition. <P> Add to this some solid graphics (which require a Direct3D-compatible accelerator), and relatively lag-free multiplayer racing over Microsoft's own Internet Gaming Zone, and there really isn't much to complain about. Motocross Madness is, quite simply, a great deal of fun with a lot to offer both the motorcycle racing fan who wants to test his mettle on the Baja and the action fan who just wants to pull some Barneys a few hundred feet in the air. <i>--Ron Dulin</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

590,Quest for Glory 5: Dragon Fire,"['Combining the best elements of role playing with pulse-pounding action in the 3-D realm of Silmaria, <i>Dragon Fire</i> is a journey fraught with peril, mystery, and enchantment. Take the adrenaline rush alone or share it with friends on the Internet. The game is recommended for ages 13 and up.', 'I have been a Quest for Glory fan since I played the first Hero\'s Quest over seven years ago. Although I have always loved role-playing games, I never really played too many adventure games. But Hero\'s Quest blended the two genres together into a greater whole that I found instantly appealing. The series, which later became Quest for Glory, combined the dialogue, item hunts, and other classic story-driven goals of adventure games with the combat, magic, and character interaction of RPGs. Each time I sat down to play a Quest for Glory game, I walked away completely satisfied upon finishing the game. I played the first, second, and third games but never got around to playing Quest IV. That was supposed to be the last Quest for Glory game, but thanks to a plethora of fan mail, Sierra was persuaded to create a final chapter in the Quest for Glory saga. The Coles, the creators of the previous games, returned to scribe an ending to our Hero\'s tales, and I was ready to retire one of my favorite game characters in his ultimate adventure. <P> As excited as I was about putting on the shoes of Hero again, I forgave the admittedly lackluster graphics. After all, role-playing games and adventures are about story, and Quest for Glory especially is about plot, characters, and humor. Quest for Glory V has all that. In fact, after looking at my first item and talking to my first NPC, it was as if I had never left the series. The humor and style of the previous Quest games is wholly intact in this final chapter. Quest for Glory has always had a juvenile sense of humor, with corny jokes and heavy sexual innuendo. So of course, you can flirt with all the women in the game, and you can give and receive a number of groaners. Of course, this is something that Quest for Glory fans have come to expect from the series, so rather than be put off by the game\'s quirky sense of humor, I was heartened. This was the game I remembered. However, if I weren\'t a fan of the series, I don\'t know if I would appreciate the game\'s humor. <P> The basic plot requires you to answer a summons for help from the kingdom of Silmaria, nestled in the island area of Marete. Ages ago, Atlantis resided around these waters, but the Dragon of Doom crippled it, sending it to the ocean floor. A handful of mages bound the dragon to the earth with the aid of seven pillars. Now, Silmaria is suffering a chain of events that will not only destroy the kingdom, but also unleash the dragon to finish the obliteration of Atlantis. As Hero, you come to Silmaria - via the magic of your mage mentor Erasmus - to right all the wrongs perpetrated on Silmaria. Your adventures manifest themselves in the form of the Rites of Rulership. The king of Silmaria has been assassinated, and the Rites have been convened to select a new ruler. Erasmus and your liontaur companion, Rakeesh, have entered you into the contest so you can travel Marete and find the real killer. If you win the Rites and become King in the process... well, that\'s an added bonus. <P> There are seven Rites, and as you finish each one, more of the game\'s plot is revealed. You soon find that the assassinations, the raids on Silmaria\'s fishing villages, the kingdom\'s war with the tritons of Atlantis, and many other problems are all related. Eventually, you\'ll meet the mastermind behind all this evil and even confront the Dragon itself. <P> As a Quest fan, I was glad to see old faces from the previous games. Rakeesh is back, as are Elsa, Erasmus, Erana, Katrina, and several other characters. Disappointingly, Rakeesh and Erasmus have relatively small roles in the game. I liked that the characters\' dialogue trees refreshed after certain quests or periods of time. The gameworld isn\'t very large, but the continually updated events and dialogue kept the game from feeling too confined. There was always something to do. Aside from the seven main quests, there are also side quests that don\'t have to be completed but do give you special items, open new lines of dialogue with NPCs, and add to your score. The first two quests are very straightforward, but the later quests have less in the way of direction. In some ways, this is good. You are left to think up solutions on your own to the quests and to find your own way of arriving at those solutions. Some quests are clever, but other times, you could be stuck wandering around the gameworld, lost and frustrated. The middle game, especially, feels too much like an adventure game where you have to go poking and prodding at every single pixel, looking for certain items. <P> Some of the game\'s voice acting was good, but some voices were too strained and annoying (Cerberus is especially terrible). The music was good, with some excellent tracks and event-specific music. The graphics aren\'t bad, although extreme close-ups of Hero don\'t look very good. The prerendered backgrounds look nice, and the undulating sea waves are especially good. One of my biggest complaints about the game is the lack of a zoom feature in combat. Sometimes, you could be caught in a battle at the far end of the map, meaning you and your target are barely large enough to click on. This is exasperated when you cast the shrink spell. What makes the problem even worse is the bad interface, which never distinguishes between ""hot"" items and useless ones. The cursor should light up when you pass over items you can pick up, locations of interest, or enemies and characters. The interface just compounds the problem when you have to look for a specific item or panel (this is most pronounced when finding the crane operation panel on Science Island). <P> I do like that the game plays differently depending on which character you choose. Each class has a few extra quests and abilities, and solutions to certain puzzles and combat differ depending on your character\'s abilities. This definitely accentuates the role-playing aspect of the game and makes replay a very real possibility, if you can stomach rehashing some of the game\'s faults. I do think Quest for Glory is a pretty good game, but much of what fueled my desire to play the game was nostalgia. The game plays very much like what I remembered but with added stories and the chance to revisit old acquaintances. That\'s what I wanted. However, gamers unused to Quest for Glory might be put off by the less-than-stellar graphics and ""old school"" gameplay. Gamers also might be put off by Quest for Glory V\'s bugs. I ran into a few, and people have complained about several others. Some bugs prevent the completion of certain side quests, while others will dump you out to the desktop. Also, the promised multiplayer support is absent, although a patch is supposed to enable it sometime in the future. <P> I really enjoyed my first ten hours of Quest for Glory V, but as the game wore on, I became more frustrated by the pace of the game and the pixel-hunting instances of gameplay. A better interface, a quest log that showed you what you had to do, and better handling of combat would have alleviated some of my concerns. I did finish the game, and I enjoyed it overall, but the ending was definitely disappointing. As the final farewell to Hero, this game should have at least included an epilogue of some sort that let you know what happened to Hero and all his companions. Quest for Glory V has a few quirks and problems that will try your patience, but series fans will want to play this game to see old friends and follow Hero\'s last adventure. <i>--Elliott Chin</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

592,NASCAR Racing 2 - PC,"['Nascar Racing 2 from Sierra', 'Before I begin reviewing Sierra\'s NASCAR 2, allow me to make one crucial point: NASCAR 2 is not a toy. I thought I was fairly adept at your average brake-accelerate PC racer, but NASCAR draws a thin line between exhilarating action-racing and strategic planning. This is a game where every track must be considered individually when tweaking the design of your car, where you need to know where and when to pit, all while staying aware of your competition\'s position on the road. After a few hours of roaring around the oval, taking cues from your spotter through a headset (let\'s assume you\'re wearing headphones during your game) it becomes startlingly clear: NASCAR 2 is so realistic, it\'s scary. <P> First of all, NASCAR 2\'s graphics are top-notch. Sierra has improved on the frame rate of the first game, making for fluid car animation, and realistic body damage. Simply put, this is as close as most of us are going to come to participating in an actual televised race. As an added bonus, Sierra has included a paintshop-style program where you\'re given the opportunity to customize the artwork of any car on the track. Slap your dog\'s name on the hood, a smiley face on the bumper. The association doesn\'t care: In NASCAR 2 the car is your canvas. <P> I don\'t mean this wholly in an artistic sense. Half the fun of NASCAR 2 is making the ever-so-slight adjustments to your vehicle\'s tire pressure, foil height, camber, and gear ratios to achieve optimal performance for a particular track. Experienced racers - whether they\'re the real McCoy or just veteran desktop competitors - will know what all these arcane terms mean from the start. However, before hitting the first NASCAR track, most of us are going to need an quick learner\'s course. An easy to understand which-element-on-your-car-affects-what diagram made it all clear, and in no time at all I began to experiment until I felt I had a firm grasp on exactly what I could tweak to make my V-8 the finest machine on the track. <P> The AI in the game is pretty incredible. When you accidentally blindside another vehicle (or even on purpose, if you don\'t believe in good sportsmanship), the other cars realistically slow down or cautiously slide out to avoid a collision. It\'s funny, but although NASCAR 2 doesn\'t purport itself as being the kind of body-casualty ride that Psygnosis\' Destruction Derby 2 is (with its incredibly realistic incremental car damage - fenders mashing in, hoods flying off, wheels tearing from their axles, bouncing down the track, requiring a tow into the pit-stop), it certainly rivals that game damage-wise. . If you collide with another vehicle because you performed an action contradictory to your spotter\'s directions, he\'ll remind you of your ineptitude with a reprimanding ""What kind of bone-headed move was that!"" And at that point, you\'re probably so absorbed in the race that you\'ll want to go back and apologize to him personally. <P> That\'s the kind of complete immersion NASCAR 2 offers. It\'s a completely professional game, both in its execution and in its dedication to the NASCAR tradition. In fact, it\'s so that Sierra and NASCAR have teamed up to bring the game to TEN (the online Total Entertainment Network) to allow players to compete and achieve ""official"" NASCAR standings in an Internet roster. Now how cool is that? People who played and worshipped the original NASCAR already own this game. I\'m writing this review largely for gamers out there who are intimidated by realistic sims. Games like Grand Prix 2 and now NASCAR 2 have converted me: I can now rest my rocket-launcher temporarily to carry on some in-depth racing. <i>--Tim Soete</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Go for the high score on one groundbreaking table from each decade--from the 1930s to the present. The widest variety of tables, realistic ball physics, and striking graphics all add up to wickedly fast action for current and prospective pinball wizards."", 'Microsoft has done a fairly good job recently of reviving games for their nostalgia value. The Revenge of Arcade and Return of Arcade collections brought back classic \'80s arcade games from a different era when video games first began to reveal the possibilities of electronic gaming. Before that, relatively low-tech pinball tables ruled the arcade floors, and now, Microsoft has turned the clock back even further to explore the unsought realm of historical pinball simulation. Because of Microsoft\'s decision to limit itself to one pinball company, Microsoft Pinball Arcade comes off as more of an interactive history lesson than a collection of good games. <P> Microsoft Pinball Arcade attempts to simulate seven pinball games from manufacturer Gottlieb, the first being from 1931 when David Gottlieb designed the ""first"" pinball game called Baffle Ball. The rest of the tables are from the succeeding decades, showcasing innovations in design and play. Included in this collection are Baffle Ball (1931), Humpty Dumpty (1947), Knock Out (1950), Slick Chick (1963), Spirit of 76 (1976), Haunted House (1982), and Cue Ball Wizard (1992). <P> The available variations in design guarantee that each table plays remarkably different from any other. In pinball, you\'re basically playing ""against"" the design of the table so that the goal is to overcome the obstacles with a limited number of control factors (flippers, nudging, and plunger). The layout of the varied tables requires a good bit of thinking while playing to make sure you nudge or flip at exactly the right moment. To help you through all this, Microsoft\'s in-game documentation is an excellent reference source for understanding how pinball strategy works (how to flip and ""catch"" the ball) as well as giving complete layouts of the tables with descriptions of all the scoring elements within the games themselves. This resource is a godsend for novices who usually just pound the flippers in hopes of getting big points. <P> However, what the variations in table design don\'t provide is an assortment of the ""best of the best"" that pinball has to offer. Sure the tables are old and give you a great sense of how far pinball has come, but with all the money Microsoft has, couldn\'t it spare a few more bucks to include great tables from manufacturers Williams and Bally? The result is a collection of tables that range from confusing designs such as Humpty Dumpty (with no bottom flippers, only outward-angled side flippers) to a classic such as Spirit of 76, which is almost a picturesque version of pinball from its golden years. <P> The one game element that really draws you in is the faithful reproduction of the sounds from all the tables. Anything from a ball hitting a steel pin to the distinct sound of a bumper will make you sit up and notice this game amongst the myriad pinball titles out there. Even when the table design is frustrating, you\'re going to find yourself aching to get the next bonus table feature just so you can hear some classic bell sounds you haven\'t experienced yet. <P> What also elevates this game\'s style to above average is the faithful rendering of the back-glass scoring system from each table. The newer tables such as Haunted House and Cue Ball Wizard use electronic font displays to show your score, while the older tables use lighted signs such as ""2 million"" in combination with rolling dials akin to automobile odometers. The producers of the game even went so far as to make you wait for the dials to roll/reset to zero before you could play another game. <P> If you\'re eager to learn pinball, Microsoft Pinball Arcade is a great history lesson, as well as a good way to learn table navigation and scoring techniques. If you\'re just looking for a solid pinball game to pass the time, there are other games out there with more graphically entrancing features and more modern sounds. But, if you\'re an elite pinball player looking for the only game that will let you go back in time for a gem such as Slick Chick, this is the only game for you. Microsoft has done a good job recreating the past, but when it comes down to gameplay, you might wonder if other tables from the past would have been more worthy of recreation. <i>--Tahsin Shamma</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Gorgeous graphics and naturally fluid game play make all 117 holes a realistic, relaxing experience."", ""Now that the Microsoft Golf series is no longer being developed by Access, it's really beginning to shine. Because Access' contract mandated that the version developed for Microsoft be inferior to the most recent version of Links, previous incarnations of Microsoft Golf were essentially Links Lite for Windows. Since Microsoft switched over to Friendly Software and the engine used for the Greg Norman games for the Golf 98 edition, the series has steadily improved to the point that it has become a real contender in the world of golf games."", ""Golf 99's improvements are minor, following the current trend among sports games of publishing a new edition every year and only revamping the whole system every couple years. Graphically, not much seems all that different from Golf 98, beyond the golfers themselves. Courses are detailed and finely rendered, though still shy of the quality and detail in Links and Jack Nicklaus. Golfer animations appear smoother, more realistic, and more fluid than ever. The animations are still not synchronized with the mouse control. But in most golf games nowadays, few animations are."", 'The bigger change is the addition of three excellent new courses: Donald Ross Memorial, Eagle Heights, and Medalist Golf Club. These join Teeth of the Dog, the Links at Casa de Campo, Bay Harbor, and the Preserve 9, for a total of seven courses, which is more than most of the competition is offering. The courses provide a good range of challenges and are offered in sharp detail. Unfortunately, the system is no longer compatible with courses produced for Links, as it used to be, thus limiting new course selection to any future Microsoft add-on discs.', 'Control is the same as in Golf 98, with four options to choose from: three-click, two-click, mouse-swing, and ""sim"" modes. The mouse swing is adequately executed, with a wedge-shaped powerbar displaying input strength. It\'s a little hard to interpret, but it works pretty smoothly and responds to practice. The final mode is a simulation-play option that is unique to Microsoft Golf. Lifted from Greg Norman, it enables you to allot points to different swing characteristics to build a golfer profile. You execute a swing with a single click, which allows you to concentrate on course management over timed clicks. It\'s not an option most people would choose, but it does radically shift the focus of the game and allows you to experiment with different approaches to a course.', 'The big changes from the previous edition are supposed to be in multiplayer support and physics. While the former is greatly improved, the latter appears only marginally different. Multiplayer support for single and tournament games is very strong, with competition available via IPX, TCP/IP, direct connect, or the Microsoft Internet Gaming Zone. The Zone, one of the best multiplayer forums out there, provides quick and easy matchmaking and smooth connections.', ""Ball dynamics don't fare quite as well. Try as I might I couldn't see much improvement in them. Over-striking the ball still yields too little a penalty. You can essentially let it go all the way into the red on the upswing, and most of the time you won't notice any real penalty. Chipping is also supposed to be better, but I found chips from the rough and sand a little too easy, a little too often. That's too bad, since the game has an easy and powerful interface that allows you to set spin and trajectory with a simple click for a more nuanced approach to swings. Microsoft needs to work a little on its balls to bring the system up to par."", ""The rest of the game is strong, however. There are plenty of options for customizing players, right down to ball type and swing strength. The shot-specific commentary by CBS's David Feherty is good, but his color commentary is hollow and annoying. With the PGA/Tiger Woods series from EA slipping far behind, Microsoft is now clearly the third choice after Links and Nicklaus. Though Golf 99 doesn't feel like a big upgrade from the '98 edition, Microsoft's offer of a $30 rebate to owners of last year's version brings the price right in line. Without the rebate, it would be hard to recommend this one to people who own the '98 edition. For people who didn't buy Golf 98 because they associate the series with earlier, weaker entries, it's well worth a fresh look. <i>--T. Liam McDonald</i> <br />--<i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc.

602,Age of Empires: The Rise of Rome - PC,"['The Age of Empires Expansion: The Rise of Rome is the highly anticipated add-on to the award-winning, best-selling real-time strategy game Age of Empires. Focusing on the legendary Roman Empire, the Rise of Rome will challenge veterans and novices alike to wage war on an epic scale with four additional civilizations, several unique units, new technologies, and new campaigns, including the showcase campaign that focuses on the Rise of Rome itself. Includes four new civilizations - Carthage, Palmyra, Macedonia, and Rome.', 'Just as the Romans rose up and became the most advanced and powerful nation in the Western Hemisphere at the turn of the millenium, so too do the Romans replace the old civilizations to reign supreme in Ensemble\'s Age of Empires expansion pack, Rise of Rome. <P> With the planned sequel to Age of Empires pushed back to the middle of next year, the Rise of Rome expansion pack took on new meaning. Not only is it supposed to enhance the value of this year-old favorite, but it also serves as a bridge between Age of Empires and Age of Empires II. Age of Empires loosely followed the growth of the ancient civilizations, Rise of Rome is set during the reign of the Roman empire in the West, and Age of Empires II is to be set in the dark ages, after the infrastructure established by the Romans crumbled into warring pieces. <P> As both a dessert for Age of Empires fans and an appetizer for Age of Empires II, Rise of Rome is a series of hits and misses. I am a huge fan of the original game. I played numerous multiplayer games and even gave the single-player campaigns a good, honest try. I didn\'t really mind the unit limit or the questionable pathfinding. And I forgave the inadequacies of the single-player campaign because I loved multiplayer matches so much. <P> There were many that loved Age of Empires as much as I did, but there were others that just couldn\'t play this game because of a few problems. I couldn\'t really see these problems a year ago when I was first enamored of the game, but today, I finally see just what all the fuss was about: This game is far from perfect, and it has a few shortcomings that detract from the play experience. <P> The Rise of Rome expansion offers five new units, four new civilizations, four new technologies, four new campaigns, and a few user enhancements like unit queues. As expansion packs go, this one is crammed with goodies. Most of the five units were added in response to balance problems in Age. The slinger is a barracks unit that exists to counter the tool age bowman rush. The camel rider serves a similar purpose against the Bronze Age cavalry rush. The scythe chariot was created for those civilizations that lacked a heavy Iron Age cavalry unit. The armored elephant was introduced because the war elephant just wasn\'t being used enough. There wasn\'t an imbalance on the high seas, but the fire galley was nevertheless brought in to expand naval combat. <P> All the units are useful, but you won\'t soon forget the old units because these new ones are either highly specialized or expensive to research. The new additions found in Rise of Rome don\'t really change the game significantly, although they do spice up matches. The slingers and camel riders do mitigate certain rushes, but the game remains fundamentally the same, and some Rise of Rome games will end without the need to ever build an expansion unit. <P> My one issue with the new units isn\'t really a complaint, but an observation. The three ""counter"" units - slinger, camel rider, and fire galley - are highly specialized units that are great against a certain type of unit and pretty much impotent against most of the other units. The scythe chariot and armored elephants are great, although they are expensive upgrades to existing units, in the same fashion as cataphracts and centurions. The scythe chariot addresses some civilizations\' lack of heavy cavalry in the Iron Age. All the new units have good animation and sound, although the lanky gait of the camel rider bothered me. <P> The four new civilizations are good additions to the game, with some nice special abilities to entice you to play them. The two interesting civilizations are the Macedonians (four times as resistant to conversion) and the Romans (master builders). The other two civilizations, Palmryans and Carthaginians, aren\'t quite as interesting. One questionable thing about the new civs is the increased cost of Palmryan villagers, without significant benefits to justify the cost. <P> The four new technologies aren\'t must-haves, but they have their uses. Two make the priest even more powerful, while one adds a nominal bonus to infantry armor against missile attacks, and the other allows you to build barracks units beyond the population limit. I must say that the way Ensemble implemented the priests\' new martyrdom ability (which allows you to instantly convert a unit by sacrificing your priest) leaves much to be desired. Instead of adding a button to the interface to allow you to click to martyr your priest, you have to convert normally and then hit delete. The interface of the game is otherwise good, but this seems to me more like a last-minute work-around. Couldn\'t Ensemble have just spent the time to add a button to the priest interface? <P> Probably the best thing about the expansion pack is the suite of user enhancements, which includes adjustable unit limits, unit queues, and adjustable pathfinding. These improvements do make the game better. <P> As in the first, the single-player game is the biggest drawback. The campaigns are unusually short, which is fine. However, there are no cutscene rewards for campaign victories. Many individual scenarios had interesting premises, but there is no purpose for the overall campaigns, just a loose theme and some random missions. I had hoped that Ensemble would make the solo experience more rewarding, but it isn\'t. The scenarios within each campaign play more like a puzzle game. These new missions are hard, not because the artificial intelligence is more challenging, but because the scenario setup is more puzzle-like and tedious. <P> The other thing that really diffused my enjoyment of the expansion was the terrible pathfinding. I forgave it in Age of Empires, and even though it has been improved, it is still bad. Invariably, when you tell a group of units to go around a forest to get to another point, half of them will get stuck in the trees, too stupid to know to walk around the foliage. <P> Rise of Rome is not a must-buy. I like parts of the expansion pack, but there isn\'t enough compelling content to make me want to go out and add it to my multiplayer matches. All the additions are nice, but they aren\'t necessary for your continued enjoyment. If you are a big Age of Empires fan, you\'ll want to check out the new units and civilizations, as well as the user enhancements, but you won\'t be getting a significant upgrade to the single-player experience or the pathfinding, two problems that Ensemble knew were in the original but somehow didn\'t address in this expansion pack. <I>--Elliott Chin</I> <BR><I>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

As the guiding spirit of a Stone Age tribe, follow one of these paths to build the greatest civilization on earth. <i>Age of Empires</i> is a real-time strategy game, spanning ten thousand years, in which players are the guiding spirits in the evolution of a small Ice Age tribe. Starting with minimal resources, players are challenged to build their tribes into great civilizations and choose from one of several ways to win the game, including world domination by conquering enemy civilizations, exploration of the ""known"" world, and economic victory through the accumulation of wealth.', 'When you first play Age of Empires, a warm feeling develops in your gut. Warcraft meets Civilization! Real-time empire-building! And does it ever look sharp and feel right.', ""But an uneasy feeling builds as you get deeper into it, a sense that all is not quite right. This is not quite the game you hoped for. Even worse, it has some definite problems. The pitfall when you review a game as anticipated and debated as this one is to make sure you criticize it for what it is, not for what you wish it was. I wish that Age of Empires was what it claimed to be - Civilization with a Warcraft twist. Instead, it is Warcraft with a hint of Civilization. That's all well and good, but it places it firmly in the action-oriented real-time combat camp, rather than in the high-minded empire-building of Civilization. The result is Warcraft in togas, with slightly more depth but a familiar feel."", 'Age of Empires places you on a map in an unexplored world, provides a few starting units, and lets you begin building an empire. Each game unfolds the same way. You begin with a town center and some villagers. The villagers are the basic laborers, and the town center enables you to build more of them and expand your settlement. The villagers are central to AOE: they gather resources, build structures, and repair units and buildings. Resources come in four forms: wood, food, stone, and gold. A certain amount of each is consumed to build various units and buildings, research new technology, and advance a civ to the next age.', 'There is no complex resource management or intricate economic model at work here. What you have is the same old real-time resource-gathering in period garb, with four resources instead of one or two. As your civ advances, you develop greater needs for these resources, but the way in which they are gathered and used becomes only marginally more complex (certain research can cause faster harvesting or more production). It appears on the surface to be a complex evocation of the way early civs gathered and used materials, but beneath the hood is the same old ""mine tiberium, buy more stuff than the other guys"" model. It is the first hint that AOE is a simple combat game rather than a glorious empire-builder.', ""There's no denying the thrill the first time a villager chucks a spear at an antelope and spends several minutes hacking meat from its flank with a stone tool. This is the level of detail that brings an empire-building game to life. If only those villagers would grow and develop over the course of the game, it would make it so much more interesting. If only they would trade in their loincloths for some britches and maybe some orange camouflage, and switch from spears to arrows and rifles. Yes, that's another game, but it could easily have been done in AOE, and why it wasn't is a mystery."", ""The problem is that while enemy AI is savvy and aggressive (it can afford to be since it appears to cheat with resources), your units are bone-stupid. Path-finding is appallingly botched, with units easily getting lost or stuck. There is a waypoint system, but that hardly makes up for the fact that your units have trouble moving from point A to point B if you don't utilize it. Military units will stand idly by while someone a millimeter away is hacked to pieces. They respond not at all to enemy incursion in a village and wander aimlessly in the midst of battle. Was this deliberate so that the gamer needed to spend more time in unit management? If so, it was a poor idea, since there is simply too much going on midgame to worry about whether your military is allowing itself to be butchered in one corner of the map while you are aggressively tending to a battle in another portion."", ""AOE obviously is sticking close to an early-empire motif, and there's nothing at all wrong with that. Stone, Tool, Bronze, and Iron are the four ages, and with each come new structures and military units. You don't earn these advanced ages - you buy them with resources. Advancement is a simple matter of hoarding and spending food and gold. The overall welfare of your state is irrelevant as long as it survives: happiness is not measured, trade is barely modeled, and the state exists merely to produce a military machine to crush everyone else on the map. Naval power has a woefully unbalancing effect upon gameplay, with a strong navy able to shred the competition at the expense of reality."", 'Micromanagement is the name of the game in AOE. There is no unit queue, and to build five villagers, you need to build one, wait, build another, and so on. With units acting so stupidly, you should be able to set their level of aggression and the manner in which they attack (a la Dark Reign), but that is also not an option. Diplomacy is relegated to tribute and nothing more, and alliances are hard to form. You can be allied, neutral, or at war with other civs, but if the radio button is still set to ""allied"" when an opponent starts firing on your units, your units will not fire back, defend themselves, or even flee. They will just be destroyed. Cues as to exactly what\'s happening on the map are obscure; the duty has been relegated to unrelated sound effects. Does that bugle call mean my building is finished being built, or my units are under attack? How about some help, people? Victory conditions can also be irritating. There are several campaigns that require that specific goals be met, and these quickly grow tiresome. Thankfully, there is an excellent custom generator that lets you set map size, starting tech, resources, and other features. This is the saving grace of AOE, and what kept me coming back again and again. The main reason is that it let me change some of the insane default victory requirements, such as when the victor is the first to build a ""wonder"" (through another massive consumption of resources) that stands for 2000 years. These 2000 years can pass in about twenty minutes of game time. That means that as soon as an opponent builds a wonder, you create a whacking huge navy to go over and blow it up. Not a very subtle way to maintain an empire. In fact, there is no strategic nuance: It is merely a brawny muscle contest.', ""If all these judgments seem harsh, it is only because Age of Empires looked, and pretends, to be so very much more. It still has tons of potential and a fundamental gameplay that remains entertaining enough to overcome the flaws and merit a fair rating. The system can go very far with some fine-tuning, but as it stands it seems downright schizo. Is it a simplified Civilization or a modestly beefed up Warcraft? It's almost as if the designers started out to create one game and ended up with another. With such beautiful production and the fundamentals of a vastly entertaining game, it's sad that it fell short of the mark. The disappointment is not merely with what AOE is, but with what it failed to be. <i>--T. Liam McDonald</i> <br /><i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Record single and multiplayer games for later playback. A printed 184-page manual and a 152-page full-color <I>Compendium of the Starsiege Universe</I> are included.', ""While it may seem that giant robot sims comprise a prolific genre, the three facts remain that nobody but Activision has made one in years, that no one but Activision ever did a very good job, and that Activision only got it right with the original MechWarrior 2. As such, the nebulous mech genre remains unrefined, and in recent years, underrepresented. If nothing else, then, Sierra's Starsiege brings new life to a genre otherwise devoid of it, even if it doesn't really succeed in elevating robot sims out of their long-term rut. It's a great looking game, and a lot of energy was put into its story and setting, but that energy should have been redistributed in the interest of gameplay. <P> Sierra's always wanted you to notice the Earthsiege universe. Starsiege is the sixth game in the universe, and it tries harder than ever to get you involved in the story. You get a book dedicated exclusively to setting the scene, with a complete historical account of the future conflict. That's in addition to the actual gameplay manual, which is also first-rate. The plot is fully realized within the game, with cinematic cutscenes, mission briefing voice-overs, and in-engine scripted sequences, all of which attempt to draw you into the game. The attempt succeeds, and were it not for the story you'd have a harder time accepting some of Starsiege's problems that gradually become evident. <P> Starsiege's 3D engine is fast and colorful, and the terrain looks authentic, with atmospheric hazing that creates a believable sense of scale. You'll actually feel isolated in the immense landscapes if you stop to look around, but despite the desolate Solar System settings, the detailed terrain always looks beautiful. The stars shine at night, the sun beats down during the day, and foreboding half-buried derelict machinery adds that extra incentive to get out of there alive. This rich scenery will look familiar to Starsiege: Tribes players, who've long since realized the tactical advantages that go hand-in-hand with being able to see an enemy as it appears as a speck on the horizon. <P> Terrain notwithstanding, the giant robots in Starsiege look rather plain. Most of the vehicle designs are forgettable even if they are highly detailed, although a few of the larger machines look particularly sinister. You can quickly identify the weapons on any given adversary, and all are especially well animated, and pivot and recoil discernibly. However, the vehicles themselves don't manage to convey the appropriate sense of scale because they move about just a little too quickly and end up looking like they're made of plastic rather than heavy metal. The destruction of a target exacerbates the sense that these are toys rather than war machines, as they merely split apart at the seams and the pieces go twirling around. Fortunately, the fiery explosions themselves look good, as do the various colorful weapon special effects. <P> Still, what really hinders suspension of disbelief in Starsiege is not so much the look of the game, but rather its strangely subdued sound effects. Some of the largest machines in the game hardly even make a sound as they walk about, and even when they go up in flames, the explosions are strangely silent. Meanwhile, the CD audio soundtrack is an inconsistent mix of techno and bass-heavy industrial tunes, some of which are inspiringly fast-paced, while others are embarrassingly bad. At least the voice acting in the mission briefings and other story sequences is consistently good. But if Starsiege had only sounded more visceral, that would have helped compensate for its gameplay. <P> It isn't the case that Starsiege plays badly; it's fast for a giant robot sim, and the campaign missions are tough, concise, and mostly well designed. But the problem is that Starsiege seems confused. The game abandons the typical torso-twisting mechanics of the genre for a control scheme that demands comparison with first-person shooters. Forget your flight stick - the game practically demands you aim using the mouse, with which you can pinpoint your weapons quickly on any area of the screen. This becomes especially critical if you pilot a tank instead of a walker, as tanks can swivel their weapons in a full radius. Yet no matter how precise you think you are, hit detection in Starsiege feels suspiciously inconsistent, and you'll often miss your mark even though you swore you had it in your sights. At other times you'll hit, or get hit, but won't notice. The Starsiege machines don't ostensibly respond to damage and just continue to go about their business, while your HUD doesn't clearly represent how much damage you've taken. <P> It isn't difficult to overlook Starsiege's many minor faults, in light of what it actually does right: the game looks good, and its story is well integrated. Its vehicles are fully customizable, and the game plays well without feeling either simplistic or obtuse. Multiplayer Starsiege, your only other option besides the campaign, isn't to be overlooked either. The game includes complete Internet multiplayer functionality straight out of the box, with plenty of deathmatch and capture-the-flag maps, as well as the option to host custom servers with whatever restrictions you like. CTF Starsiege is quite fun, and makes a lot of sense since the smaller, faster vehicles in the game are ideal flag runners, but entirely incapable of fighting against larger opponents. Then again, the overall slower pace will take a lot of getting used to for Tribes players, most of whom will probably prefer that game's more dynamic feel. After all, the vehicles in Starsiege control about the same as Tribes' foot soldiers, but they're slower and can't even jump. <i>--Greg Kasavin</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

610,Return to Krondor - PC,"[""This sequel to <i>Betrayal at Krondor</i> offers many elements of the original game while taking advantage of technological advances. Players trek to investigate the disappearance of the Ishapian church's most sacred relic, the Tear of the Gods."", 'After an incredible series of twists and turns during development, the official sequel to one of the most popular role-playing games ever, 1993\'s Betrayal at Krondor, has finally arrived. Unlike last year\'s Betrayal in Antara, which was very similar in style, if not in quality, to Betrayal at Krondor, the official sequel is a very different game from its predecessor. <P> Return to Krondor, like Betrayal at Krondor, is set in author Raymond E. Feist\'s swords-and-sorcery world of Midkemia. Both games provide strongly story-driven experiences, as evidenced by the fact that they are divided into ""chapters,"" during which the plot is advanced in a very linear, predetermined fashion. Similarly, both games require you to use preset characters, each possessing a fully developed, distinctive personality, and determine party membership solely in response to plot developments over which you have no control. But while Betrayal at Krondor allowed you to develop your character in a variety of ways while exploring a vast gaming world and undertaking numerous subquests, Return to Krondor offers much more restrictive gameplay. Each chapter in Return to Krondor is set in a very discrete, confining geographic area (one room, in the case of two of the chapters), and most chapters have no subquests at all, forcing you to focus solely on your primary quest objectives. The handful of available subquests are all interesting and do an excellent job at drawing you deeper into Krondor\'s world, and the main storyline is consistently compelling. In fact, you are likely to race through the already brief game because the lure of advancing the storyline by proceeding directly to the next key objective is difficult to resist. <P> Set directly in the city of Krondor and its nearby surroundings, Return to Krondor\'s main plot involves retrieving an immensely powerful artifact, the Tear of the Gods, after it was relegated to a watery grave by an ambitious pirate, Bear. Bear has been carving a grisly path of destruction throughout the world of Midkemia as he has sought to capture the power of the Tear of the Gods to achieve his nefarious ends. To hastily save the day, a not-so-unlikely band of heroes is formed, consisting of a reformed master thief, an exotic court mage, a vengeful member of the city guard, a priest hailing from the temple that previously maintained the lost artifact, and finally, a reluctant guildsman who has been known to hurl a spell or two upon occasion. <P> While Betrayal at Krondor was primarily a first-person-perspective game, Return to Krondor opts for a stylish, but occasionally disorienting, variety of third-person perspectives. Unlike the suddenly abundant third-person-perspective games using a ""trailing camera,"" in Return to Krondor the camera angles are stationary in each scene, although you can choose from a variety of camera views in most key encounter areas in the game. As you move your party through the gaming world, using either directional keys or by simply mouse-clicking on a targeted location, you prompt automatic shifts in the game\'s camera perspective. The frequently shifting camera perspectives is often disorienting, since clicking on a location at the top of your screen regularly results in your characters actually moving towards the bottom of the screen after an involuntary camera switch. In the vast majority of outdoor locations, you can\'t readily switch back to a previous perspective, making it easy to initially lose orientation as you suddenly view the gaming world from a different angle. <P> The differences between the Direct3D version of the game and the proprietary ""True 3D"" software version are minor, which is a compliment to the software version rather than a critique of the hardware-accelerated version. The lush background scenery in the game is often truly beautiful, and the characters are rendered in great detail, with distinctive faces (complete with lip-synching mouths) and appearances that change to reflect their equipped armor and weaponry. Scripted cutscenes are plentiful and do an excellent job of keeping you immersed in the gaming world while advancing the plot and further developing the personalities of characters in the game. <P> Combat in the game is turn-based although not as tactical as typical turn-based role-playing games because you have fewer options available to your characters. Combat is always to the death (apparently there\'s no such thing as a well-advised retreat among the bloodthirsty Krondorians) and, with some notable exceptions, usually occurs in a relatively confined area. There are six schools of magic (four for mages, two for priests), and spells cast during combat exhibit suitably colorful and otherwise impressive effects. Mage spells can either be ""quick cast"" immediately, which could result in a spell failure, or ""slow cast"" over two turns, in which case the spell will be lost if the caster is hit prior to launching the spell. Priest spells are always successfully invoked and can be cast using spell points or, for the masochist in you, the life points of the caster. Unlike Betrayal at Krondor, combat does not occur on a separate ""grid-like"" combat screen. There is always a color-coded circle beneath the active character or enemy in combat, allowing you to instantly determine the relative health and spell points of that character or enemy. Unfortunately, while the lack of a clearly marked movement ""grid"" makes the environment more immersive, it also makes it difficult to quickly determine a character\'s movement range. <P> Both of the previous Betrayal games featured complicated methods of opening treasure chests found during the course of the game. But instead of punishing gamers with the notoriously tedious ""bead"" puzzles of Betrayal in Antara or the riddle puzzles in Betrayal at Krondor, this time the treasure chests actually add to gameplay, rather than distract from it. A thief\'s task of unlocking and disarming a chest is graphically represented in Return to Krondor, albeit in a somewhat abstract manner. Gamers still not wanting to mess around with the puzzle chest can elect to have the game automatically determine whether or not the thievish Squire James is successful at opening a chest based solely upon his lock-picking and disarming skills. You\'ll gather hoards of treasure from defeated foes during the course of the game and unfortunately also spend a significant amount of time tediously identifying or moving that treasure from corpses to your characters\' backpacks. Each individual item in the game has to be specifically assessed and moved, and your victims\' bodies have to exasperatingly be searched one by one. <P> The game\'s main problem, however, is clearly its brevity. Although there are a few difficulty settings and the option to make mages more or less effective at spell-casting, these alternatives are unlikely to significantly prolong the game\'s replayability. Return to Krondor is certainly not a massive and open-ended role-playing game set in an expansive gaming world. With its distinctive, preset characters, scripted events, and limited geographical scope, Return to Krondor is a more linear, story-driven, and somewhat more intimate game. While Return to Krondor may not be an epic sequel to Betrayal at Krondor, its excellent graphics and immersive plot and gaming world make it an enjoyable story-driven game while it lasts. <i>--Desslock</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

614,Sierra Sports: Grand Prix Legends - PC,"[""<i>Grand Prix Legends</i> is a racing simulation based on the drivers, teams, tracks, and cars of the 1967 Grand Prix Season--a season known as the most dangerous in racing history. The game features fast unstable cars, historical racetracks, and some of the world's most famous drivers."", 'How real is real enough - or, in the case of Grand Prix Legends, how real is too real? <P> Those are questions some gamers will be asking themselves after wrestling to complete a single lap - without spinning out or crashing, that is - on any of the eleven world-famous tracks featured in Grand Prix Legends, Papyrus\' newest racing sim that\'s being rightly hailed as the most realistic simulation ever developed. <P> Grand Prix Legends is a nearly perfect re-creation of the 1967 Grand Prix season, with Watkins Glen, Monza, Spa-Francorchamps, Rouen-les-Essarts, Mosport, Silverstone, Kyalami, Zandvoort, Mexico City, Monte Carlo, and the mighty Nurburgring modeled in the sim; only Le Mans is missing, and only two teams (Cooper and Honda) are missing from that year. <P> In addition to five historically accurate cars - the Lotus-Ford 49, the Repco-Brabham BT24, the Eagle-Weslake T1G, the Ferrari 312, and the BRM H-16 - Papyrus has also included two fantasy cars, the Murasama and the Coventry (obviously meant to take the places of Honda and Cooper, respectively). And of course there are the drivers: Gurney, Clark, Hill, McLaren, and many others who literally put their lives on the line in pursuit of victory and to slake their thirst for raw power and speed. <P> It might sound like a tired cliche, but each of these cars really does have its own distinct characteristics, and if you don\'t believe me, then try driving the Murasama after you\'ve gotten used to the Lotus or the Ferrari. They all, however, share a common trait: They\'re incredibly hard to drive. That shouldn\'t come as any big surprise; put a novice in a lightweight car with a 400-plus horsepower engine and no type of aerodynamic additions like spoilers or wings to provide down force, and it\'s only natural he\'ll find himself flipping, spinning, rolling, and generally doing everything except staying upright and heading around the track. Even after heading to the pits over and over again to tweak the almost innumerable settings for suspension, fuel, tires, and so on, you\'re likely to still find it hard to handle these beasts - at least if you want to keep up with the rest of the pack. <P> It\'s not as though Papyrus tried to pull the wool over anyone\'s eyes regarding the game\'s difficulty level and steep learning curve. On the second page of the manual - not to be confused with the nearly 100-page strategy guide bundled with the game, without which the learning curve might become vertical - you\'ll find this statement: ""You will spin and crash because everyone who tries the simulation spins and crashes the first time out. And the second time out. And the third. People who have raced real cars spin and crash in the simulator - mainly because they aren\'t feeling the forces they are used to feeling while driving."" <P> And it\'s that last little bit that leads me to my only serious complaint against an otherwise stunning achievement: Why didn\'t Papyrus attempt to ease the learning curve with a few realism toggles? These cars are incredibly difficult to drive when you are getting real-world feedback, and they become absolute bears when you don\'t have any input except what you see on a computer monitor and hear through some speakers. <P> How about a toggle for a traction meter that would give some idea of how close you are to spinning out? Or an option to put a ""governor"" on the top speed of the computer-controlled drivers so you could race with the physics model fully active and at least be competitive as you gradually mastered the sim? It\'s true that there are driving aids for shifting, throttle, and braking, but these are little more than crutches that slow you down more than teach you how to handle the toughest driving sim ever created. Instead, it\'d be far better to have an option to make the opponents a little dumber and a little slower so you could first learn how to race and then work on speed. I know, I know - you can get your chops down in the game\'s training mode. But that doesn\'t change the fact that GPL might lure more people in if at least some of them could find a way to be competitive from the green flag. <P> And I really want more people to get into this sim, because once it casts its spell on you - even if that takes 10 or 15 hours - you\'re likely to be hooked for a long, long time to come. I know, because I was just about to throw up my hands and walk away when I actually finished in the top ten (in a field of 20) at Monza - and I felt so happy and proud that it was almost like an early Christmas present. Yes, Monza\'s one of the easiest tracks, and I had the race length set to novice. But that one little taste of success was enough to have me eager to climb back in the Lotus and set my sights on even tougher challenges. <P> What makes GPL even more entrancing is the wonderful graphical flourishes - the bystanders, the animated officials, accurate mirrors (mind blowing the first time you see them), and drivers shifting down and turning the wheel as they enter turns. The instant replay feature gets a near-perfect score, as do the outstanding artificial intelligence routines developed for the drivers. Tracks and background scenery are first-rate in 3D-accelerated mode (more on that later), but you won\'t fully appreciate how well they\'re done until you\'re able to sit back and watch the drama unfold on replay. <P> About the only quibble I have with gameplay is the limited number of views: Like Papyrus\' previous IndyCar Racing and NASCAR Racing games, GPL has only two views (cockpit and chase) available during the race, but about ten during the replay. I\'m certainly not going to race from the nose view, but I\'d like to access the roll-bar view because it gives you greater viewing distance down the track (another potential way of balancing the hyperrealistic physics model). As it stands, the only way to access anything besides the two standard views is to edit the PLAYER.INI file - and if you hit F10 to access the chase view, then it wipes out the changes and sticks you back in the cockpit. <P> A lot of racing fans have raved about the game\'s multiplayer action even over the Internet, but Papyrus and Sierra have come up a little short of the mark by failing to provide even a rudimentary chat area where GPL owners can meet and arrange matches. There are a couple of web sites that provide such a feature, and of course you can always check out the #gpl channel on IRQ or head to Kali to look for opponents. But just as with the game\'s learning curve, these are things we veterans take for granted but which are likely to be off-putting for newbies or casual gamers. <P> Besides plenty of patience, you\'ll also need one other thing to fully enjoy GPL: a fairly high-end system with a good control setup. Papyrus recommends a 266MHz with 64MB RAM and a 3D card using either the 3dfx or Rendition chipset (strangely, there\'s no Direct3D support), but I suspect that you\'ll need a 300MHz to run at 800x600 in 16-bit color against a full field of opponents. As far as controllers go, the Microsoft Force Feedback Wheel worked like a charm even though the game doesn\'t have force-feedback support, but I also got nice results with a pedal/wheel combo as well. <P> Grand Prix Legends isn\'t for everyone, but that little adage is true of many of the finer things in life. Provided you\'ve got enough computing muscle to run it smoothly and the patience to stay with it long past the first feelings of frustration, Grand Prix Legends will reward you with arguably the most intense racing experience ever seen on a personal computer. <i>--Stephen Poole</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

616,Red Baron 3-D - PC,"['The realistic graphics and effects of this game take you back to the early days of aviation, when daring pilots flew their dogfight missions on one part courage and one part technology. <i>Red Baron 3-D</i> excels in its attention to detail and use of innovative graphics technology. The game is suitable for all ages.', 'Few things are more disappointing than a sequel that doesn\'t live up to its predecessor. You\'re looking for another Jurassic Park and you end up with The Lost World (or Trespasser, for that matter). Such was the case with Red Baron II, last year\'s sequel to 1990\'s hit World War I sim. Its promising dynamic campaign environment was hobbled by poor graphics performance, nonfunctional multiplayer modes, crippled flight models, and more bugs than a North Carolina picnic. <P> To its credit, Sierra\'s Dynamix division didn\'t take its money and run, promising to do better next time, but rather spent the last year working on a series of patches to bring the program up to speed and add 3D support. The result is Red Baron 3D, a program that\'s a worthy successor to the original. Best of all, Red Baron 3D is available at absolutely no cost to purchasers of Red Baron II. <P> Other than the fixes, the addition of 3D support, and multiplayer enhancements, Red Baron 3D is essentially the same program as last year\'s release. That\'s not a criticism, however, as its feature set more than holds its own against more recent designs. The simulation features 22 different flyable World War I aircraft, along with 18 other types flown by AI pilots. These planes can be flown in a dynamic campaign, on a variety of scripted single missions, and in an instant-action mode. The campaign is especially well done, with more atmosphere and less repetition than the dynamic campaigns found in recent jet sims. You\'re likely to encounter other flights and targets of opportunity - friendly and enemy - en route to and from the target. The missions are better balanced than in the original release. For instance, waypoints don\'t take you over every enemy antiaircraft gun in the country anymore. <P> Flight models have seen dramatic improvement in Red Baron 3D. The original simplified flight model is intact for beginners, but new intermediate and authentic settings will give more experienced sim players a more convincing experience, with features such as torque, spins, gyroscopic effects, and deadly spins. The overall model is very convincing, and it would take quite a bit of test-flying to find the few performance differences between the models and their real-life counterparts. <P> Cockpits have been given an overhaul as well. The virtual cockpit is now as readable as the standard cockpit, making for improved situational awareness while tracking enemies with padlock views. One innovative feature in 3Dfx mode is a toggle to make the cockpit and wings transparent. While this is obviously not realistic (real flight sim fans know it didn\'t come around until Wonder Woman\'s invisible plane was built during World War II), it does make tracking enemies much easier, while still maintaining the ability to use your plane\'s fuselage to keep track of the direction you\'re looking. <P> As you\'d expect from the sim\'s name, Red Baron 3D has undergone a major graphics overhaul. Running on a 3Dfx card, you\'ll find that the formerly blocky terrain graphics have been smoothed out with bilinear filtering. At low altitudes, trees pop up to give you a better reference as to your height above the ground. Explosions and other effects have been tuned as well, and the sim now supports up to 1024x768 resolution. <P> Unfortunately, those effects are available only on 3Dfx cards - there\'s no support for Direct3D, so cards with chipsets such as the Riva TNT or Matrox G200 will run the sim only in 2D DirectDraw mode. The 2D mode does support the higher resolutions, but even on a Pentium II/400 I needed to stick to 640x480 resolution to keep the frame rates completely smooth. <P> The sim\'s sounds deserve special praise. From the various engine sounds to the creaking of wooden struts as you stress your plane\'s airframe to the screams of enemy pilots as they jump from burning planes sans parachutes, they do a wonderful job of immersing you into the sim. <P> All these improvements serve to bring the program to the state at which it should have been released in the first place. But Dynamix didn\'t stop there. The formerly practically useless multiplayer mode has been tossed out and completely replaced with a server-based massively multiplayer version. You can now battle for free against up to 100 other human opponents via Sierra\'s free WON.NET matchmaking service, as well as on user-run servers (server software is included on the CD). Modes include melee (essentially deathmatch), team melee, and a capture-the-flag-style ""Get the Baron"" mode where only the last person to get a kill scores points. Unfortunately, there\'s no support for playing the sim\'s excellent missions cooperatively. <P> If you were disappointed by the initial release of Red Baron II, you definitely should give the program another try. You can download a patch for the original disc that includes everything you\'ll find on the Red Baron 3D CD (except for the server software) from www.redbaron3d.com. Or if you prefer, you can purchase Red Baron 3D, send back a form, the receipt, and your original Red Baron II CD, and Sierra will refund you the entire purchase price of Red Baron 3D. <P> While Red Baron II owners obviously have every reason to upgrade, this sim merits consideration by any fan of historical flight sims. Only MicroProse\'s new European Air War comes close to Red Baron 3D in capturing the atmosphere of historical air combat. Kudos to Sierra and Dynamix for taking a disappointing disaster and turning it into the best World War I simulation yet. <P> Editor\'s Note: The Red Baron 3D rebate offer mentioned in the review has ended. The patch to upgrade Red Baron II is still available. <i>--Denny Atkin</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

618,Homeworld - PC,"['<i>Homeworld</i> is the next evolution of real-time strategy gaming, delivering a fresh experience in a totally 3-D universe. It gives players freedom to create new styles of play while delivering cinema-quality graphics, special effects, vividly rendered ships, and an innovative interface.', 'Relic\'s Homeworld is the sort of game that can inspire unbridled hyperbole in game reviewers. With its stunning 3D engine, uniquely challenging gameplay in both single- and multiplayer modes, great audio, and terrific story, Homeworld is both an excellent game and one that may well reshape the entire real-time strategy genre. <P> It begins with an epic discovery: An ancient starship, buried deep beneath the sands of your home planet Kharak, contains evidence indicating that your people descended from aliens who colonized the planet many centuries ago. Spurred on by this discovery, your people construct a massive mothership with hyperspace capabilities and undertake an expedition to find their true homeworld. However, you complete your first hyperspace jump only to run smack into a swarm of hostile aliens, which proceed to reduce Kharak to a burning wasteland. Now, with only the mothership to call home, you must lead the fleet onward to your fabled homeworld, exacting vengeance for Kharak along the way. <P> Most of the plot unfolds by way of elaborate cutscenes created using the game\'s 3D engine. The game also makes use of some slick hand-drawn animation to convey other elements of the story. These black-and-white scenes have a simple but gritty look to them, and they work exceptionally well with the flashy 3D cinematics. <P> Homeworld\'s gameplay is in fact fairly similar to any tried-and-true real-time strategy game. You have a fleet under your command and must guide it through a series of 16 missions by building more vessels, researching new technologies, and harvesting resources from asteroids and dust clouds. <P> However, in spite of the basic formula, Homeworld manages to feel like a very different breed of game. Your ships and resources carry over from mission to mission. This can result in very different playing habits designed to preserve your precious fleet. After all, it\'s the only one you have. For example, you\'ll come to rely on vessels like the support frigate to repair your damaged ships so they are ready for the next mission. Similarly, you might find yourself sticking around after completing your mission goals to harvest every last ounce of space dust available. Thankfully, Homeworld lets you do this sort of thing, because you control when you exit each mission regardless of when and how the mission goals are accomplished. <P> But the most obvious difference between this and other real-time strategy games is the true 3D nature of the gameworld. You\'re in deep space, after all, so there is no restriction on the direction in which your units may travel. As a result, you\'ll have to learn to think and move using three axes at all times. This can be extremely confusing if you jump right in, which is why you ought to go through Homeworld\'s excellent tutorial regardless of your experience with real-time strategy games. One thing the tutorial doesn\'t teach you is the best way to keep track of your units once a battle begins. Though you have numerous options for organizing your ships - including a variety of formations and three different attack styles - it can be quite easy to scatter them across the galactic map if you\'re not careful. The main culprit here is the convoluted 3D movement command. In order to move your ships along the Z-axis, you must first click on an X-Y destination, then hold the shift key and move the mouse to indicate the distance up or down that you wish your ships to travel. Be warned that this system can be incredibly difficult to master, especially if you don\'t take the time to line things up perfectly. <P> Fortunately, you won\'t mind retrying some of Homeworld\'s missions a few times until you get them right, because you never get the sense that the computer is cheating you. These missions are challenging, especially towards the end of the campaign, but they are fair. Even so, you may be put off by the complete lack of a difficulty setting. <P> You\'ll also enjoy playing Homeworld repeatedly because it has some of the most impressive graphics ever. This 3D engine is stunning, with an acute attention to detail that is staggering. Every ship, from the tiny scout fighter to the lumbering heavy cruiser, is amazingly detailed, right down to markings on the hull and individually animated gun turrets. One of the coolest features in the game is the ability to zoom right in on a single ship and follow it through a battle - every turn, maneuver, and shot fired is brought to life, and you get a front-row seat for all of it. <P> The ship design itself is also pretty impressive. And though the two sides in the conflict have nearly identical arsenals (there are only two unique ship classes per side), each has a completely different stylistic approach that is consistent throughout the fleet. Weapons effects are suitably spectacular, and explosions are also very cool, especially when the doomed vessel is penetrated by a beam weapon as it blows up - an effect that recalls those great ship explosions from the old Star Blazers cartoons. <P> The audio in Homeworld is just as impressive as the graphics engine. The new-age musical score may not appeal to everyone, but it does a great job of setting the whole ""space is really, really big"" mood. The unit acknowledgments and sound effects are equally good, though it can be difficult to determine which of your units is asking for more fuel when the call comes in during a heated battle. <P> Homeworld\'s multiplayer support is excellent. The game lets up to eight players compete over the Internet via WON.net. LAN play is also provided, with both IPX and IP networks supported. In multiplayer matches, you can fully customize the game settings, including the presence, skill level, and hostile tendencies of any AI opponents. A skirmish mode is also included if you only wish to play against computer opponents. Resource availability can be modified, and harvesting can even be deactivated completely. The alternative is a periodic infusion of resources for all players. Regrettably, some players have experienced random drops and crashes during online play, and the game tends to really slow down or shut down completely if you throw too many ships into the mix. <P> Homeworld does have a few other issues that deserve mention. There is no way to tell how much damage an enemy ship has sustained. Even though your own ships have clearly visible health bars, the status of enemy ships remains unknown until just before they explode, at which point they begin to smoke and burn. And while you can play the game as either of the two warring parties, the single-player campaign is exactly the same for each side. It seems like Relic really dropped the ball here, since even a perfectly parallel campaign would have been a welcome diversion - and a way to extend the life of the meager single-player game. In fact, an opposing story with an equally positive spin on the conflict would have been downright cool. <P> Even so, any complaints about the basic design or mechanics of Homeworld are minor at best. This is one of the best games you\'ll see this year: The phenomenal 3D engine, the great story, and the stellar gameplay all combine seamlessly in what will surely become a longtime favorite for many gamers. <P> [Editor\'s note: The review originally stated that it is impossible for you to identify enemy ships, which is incorrect.

619,Microsoft Monster Truck Madness 2 - PC,"[""Monster Truck Madness 2 is the sequel to one of the bestselling auto-racing games for the PC. Monster Truck Madness 2 combines outrageous attitude, unrestrained racing, and real monster trucks to provide a fun and exhilarating off-road driving experience across rugged and challenging terrain. Monster Truck Madness 2 adds new tracks and trucks, improved graphics and sound, and variable weather conditions. The game seats players behind the steering wheel of the world's most powerful vehicles as they crush, splatter, jump, and roll their way to victory."", 'Sure, it\'s the Beverly Hillbillies equivalent of sports, but face it, getting into a truck cab perched atop four ludicrously gigantic tires to skid, plow, and roll through sand, mud, and other slop is not without its appeal. Microsoft\'s Monster Truck Madness was an improbable success and its sequel, Monster Truck Madness 2, is just as likely to get gamers to listen to their inner Bubba and take those garish big rigs out for a spin. <P> Monster Truck Madness 2 improves upon the original by throwing in nine new trucks, eleven new tracks, and an honest-to-goodness sports license. The designers wisely recognized that the subtlety of monster truck racing cried out for the added nuance that only a professional wrestling tie-in could bestow. The resulting WCW and NWO license means gamers can drive rigs based on the likes of Stinger and the Outlaws as well as receive a hearty FMV victory salute from Hulk Hogan himself. This time around the trucks also sport deformable bodies to reflect the pounding they take during races. <P> While Monster Truck Madness 2 does have a limited garage feature to modify your truck, nobody\'s going to confuse this with Grand Prix II - the focus here is squarely on straightforward, arcade-type action. Monster trucks aren\'t exactly precision machines, so while you might not experience the adrenaline rush of high-speed racing, you\'ll be busy struggling to keep at least two wheels on the ground as you slide, skid, and spin through every race. Owners of force feedback joysticks will face a happy extra obstacle in their fight to control these unwieldy mechanized beasts. Monster Truck Madness 2 considerately provides three skill levels and an option for automatic gear shifting, allowing you to take your time getting used to the slippery bouncing mayhem that dominates races. <P> Monster Truck Madness 2 has a good mix of both rally and circuit tracks, including the obligatory romp through oil derricks, a tropical island laced with water hazards, and a happy jaunt through a lightning-torn graveyard, complete with caskets. Most tracks feature harrowing jumps and encourage a healthy dose of cheating. As long as you hit your checkpoints, feel free to ignore the track and set your own path. Races can be customized with variable weather conditions - including rain, snow, dense fog, and more - for an extra challenge. And while you can challenge the computer in a race setting, you can\'t try to beat it in the new multiplayer-only Summit Rumble, a monster truck version of King of the Hill. Too bad, because the Rumble is a gas. <P> While 3D acceleration isn\'t required to run the game, playing it on the minimum machine will force you to shut off features to get it to run at an acceptable rate. That said, 3D acceleration is a must if you really want to enjoy Monster Truck Madness 2. A Direct3D-compatible card will get you a great frame rate as well as a bucketload of eye candy including reflective water, beautiful sky effects, and the lovingly detailed truck textures. To really enjoy Monster Truck Madness 2\'s cool graphics, set a race for ""pitch black"" and ogle at the graceful sweep of headlights careening through the track. <P> Monster Truck Madness 2 isn\'t perfect, even as an arcade racer. While it logs best race and lap times for every track, a career or simple season mode would have been a welcome addition. But if you\'ve an itch for wild, fender-busting racing action, Monster Truck Madness 2 might be just the thing to scratch it. <i>--Robert Coffey</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

620,NBA Inside Drive 2000 - PC,"[""<i>NBA Inside Drive</i> offers the speed, power, and energy of the NBA, but with a major difference: you're no longer a spectator. Drive to the hole, toss one from beyond the arc, give it up to the big guy in the paint, or take it coast to coast."", 'To say that EA Sports may have dominated the world of pro hoops simulations is like saying that President Clinton may have had an affair since he married Hillary. Sure, there have been hit arcade games like NBA Jam, and there are probably a few good stats-based simulations floating around too. But when it comes to serving up a blend of both on-court action and front-office chores, NBA Live has been the only place for roundball fans to turn.', ""The only company, in fact, that's even attempted to challenge the NBA Live dynasty has been Microsoft, first with 1997's NBA Full Court Press and now with NBA Inside Drive 2000. Developed by High Voltage Software (the same developers that brought us the fair-to-middling NCAA Final Four '97), NBA Inside Drive 2000 does a lot of things well and is a huge step up from the all-flash-and-no-substance gameplay of Full Court Press - and who can't love a $19.95 sticker price? But when all is said and done, the game's limited scope and questionable artificial intelligence routines keep it from being an NBA Live killer."", ""I thought it was at first, though. While the game lacks a career mode, the coaching options for single games and season play are about as rich as you could hope for in an NBA simulation. Each team has its own robust book of offensive plays, from which you can select up to five to use in an upcoming game - but you'd better take the time to study the diagrams very closely, because the practice mode simply takes your teams onto a city blacktop for either a shoot-around or some one-on-one action against a friend."", ""You've also got control over generic offensive and defensive settings such as tempo and rebounding aggressiveness, as well as more specific tasks, such as what sort of defense you'll play (full court, half-court, or three-quarters), how defenders should harass ball handlers, and where your big men should defend the post. You can choose to let the computer handle tempo and aggressiveness settings and manage substitutions and time-outs on the game's lower difficulty settings, but when you ratchet it up to the veteran level it's up to you to determine overall settings for tempo and aggressiveness (the computer will handle time-outs and subs, however)."", ""Once you hit the court, you'll be blown away by High Voltage's almost obsessive attention to detail in graphics and animation. Each player has a unique face, and while more care was obviously paid to ensure that high-profile players look as authentic as possible, even the benchwarmers have their own distinct appearance. Lifelike animations abound, from the slow but steady dribble of a point guard edging the ball up court, to quick hand checks, crossover dribbles, and players going airborne to bat a ball back inbounds. Each NBA venue is a masterpiece of modeling, from the convincing crowd graphics to the spot-on shadows and reflections on the wooden courts. Simply put, it looks and feels like the real thing, and the play-by-play by Kevin Calabro and Marques Johnson adds a TV-style ambience that really gets you into the action (although occasionally they'll say stuff that doesn't quite jibe with what just happened onscreen)."", ""One of the biggest complaints hard-core fans have had against the NBA Live games is that it's generally too easy to beat computer-controlled teams. High Voltage must have thought the same thing, because beating a computer-controlled team on the veteran or all-pro difficulty levels in Inside Drive is about the toughest challenge I've faced since I tried to finish in the top ten of a Grand Prix Legends race. In fact, it's difficult to the point of absurdity - and that's on the veteran level."", 'But the problem isn\'t the fact that it\'s tough to win; it\'s that there\'s really no ""perfect"" difficulty setting. When you play on rookie (next to easiest), teams score 140, 150, 160, and more, hardly any fouls are called, and dunks abound - it has just too much of an arcade feel. But when you move it up one notch to veteran, you\'ll be amazed to find yourself losing games to cellar dwellers like the Clippers and the Mavericks - and that\'s when you\'re controlling excellent squads like the Knicks, Hawks, Pacers, Spurs, Trailblazers, and even a Conference All-Star team! That\'s right: After I read about a user claiming that he lost to the Clippers (the worst team in basketball last year) while controlling the Eastern Conference All Stars, I thought I\'d give it a try - and sure enough I wound up losing too! True, I did soundly beat those same Clippers playing as the Spurs (who, strangely enough, have higher ratings in all categories than that Eastern Conference All Stars team), but there\'s still something very strange going on here.', ""The problem lies in how the computer-controlled teams beat you. Playing as the Spurs, I took on the Utah Jazz (obviously a far cry from the Clippers, but it was the Spurs' home opener for the season) three times in a row and wound up losing by at least 25 points every time out. Was it because I have zero hand-eye coordination? No. It's because Inside Drive makes things harder on the veteran setting simply by letting the computer players do things they've never done, or could ever do, in real life. In one game, Jazz centers Greg Ostertag and Greg Foster combined for 40 points - and this against the Spurs' awesome twin towers of Tim Duncan and David Robinson, as well as the steady, dependable Will Perdue. In open-mouthed amazement I watched Greg Foster and Thurl Bailey - yes, the one who played on the NC State team, which won the 1983 NCAA championship - school David Robinson time and again in the low post with turnaround jumpers, while Todd Fuller and Greg Ostertag blew by Tim Duncan at will. And that's with the computer guarding those guys: I relegated myself to playing as one of the two guards."", ""But it doesn't stop with stiffs racking up MVP numbers. Out of the blue, the opposing team would intercept four or five consecutive passes: It might happen in real life, Agnes, but I can't recall ever seeing that many steals in a row in a pro game. There's also the issue of fouls: Over and over again my best players, players that rarely get into serious foul trouble in real life, would have to sit out huge chunks of the first half because they'd been called for two before the first quarter was finished. What was even more troubling was that on several occasions the instant replay wouldn't go back far enough to let me see the infraction: All I got to see was the ref tossing the ball downcourt for the inbounds pass or free throw. The bottom line is that no matter how much patience I exercised, how carefully I managed the coaching settings, or how closely I followed the tips for defense and offense on the High Voltage web site, the same incredible events transpired game after game after game."", ""What makes this so aggravating is that up until the weirdness factor set in during each game, I was having a real blast with NBA Inside Drive 2000. And playing against a competent human opponent (only hot-seat play is supported - High Voltage says it wanted to focus on gameplay before implementing Net, LAN, or modem play) is a real kick, too. Inside Drive 2000 certainly has the core of an excellent basketball simulation, and that with the low price tag makes it worth picking up. In the end, though, only a dyed-in-the-wool EA Sports hater could claim this game to be better than NBA Live '99.<i>--Stephen Poole</i><br />--<i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

621,Professional Bull Rider - PC,"['The fast action and graphics of <i>Professional Bull Rider</i> put you in the arena. Features such as running color commentary, support for Force Feedback joysticks, and lifelike arcade play help make the rides some of the most exhilarating eight seconds you can experience at your computer.', 'Sierra Sports\' Professional Bull Rider is a very good simulation of an amazing sport. It\'s thoroughly authentic, from its beautifully motion-captured riding sequences to the tutorial narration by bull-riding greats Ty Murray and Tuff Hedeman and color commentary by PBR announcer Justin McKee. There\'s no banjo-pluckin\', yee-hawin\', or tobacco-spittin\', and the only bull in the game is a big mean critter that moves with astonishing realism and bucks like hell. Simply put, Professional Bull Rider looks great, sounds great, and plays pretty durn well too. <P>That\'s right, Professional Bull Rider plays well. It might seem like a simple arcade action game, especially if you stick to nothing but the quick-ride option, which lets you play as long as you want as either the bull or the cowboy. However, the gameplay is surprisingly complex. The controls are simple and responsive; all you need to use are four directional keys and two function keys on a keyboard, or you can use a joystick or gamepad. Playing as the bull isn\'t tremendously complex; you use the four directional controls to buck to the front or rear, or twist to either side, and the two function keys to execute hops and more powerful versions of the other maneuvers (which drain more of your stamina than normal), all in order to toss that pesky cowboy off your back. <P>Playing as the cowboy is far more difficult; you must use your controller to lean into the same direction as the bull\'s buck in order to maintain your balance, and you must make judicious use of the grip button, which drains stamina, and the spur button, which earns more points from the judges but is dangerous unless your cowboy is completely centered and upright. As in the actual sport, one missed guess will usually send you flying off the bull\'s back. Actually figuring out how to play as the cowboy is challenging and often frustrating; it\'s harder than it might seem at first and requires a great deal of patience to master, especially since the camera is fixed at a more or less head-on horizontal view during rides. As such, when riding a frantically twisting bull, it\'s often hard to remember which is right and which is left, in spite of the sometimes-helpful color commentary. And if you pause for just a moment to try to figure out which is which, chances are you\'ll be sent sprawling. However, once you get your sense of direction down pat and figure out the visual cues for each kind of buck, playing the cowboy becomes an exciting eight-second guessing game that\'s largely based on anticipation and to a lesser extent, luck - just like the real thing. And after you\'ve attained some skill with both the cowboy and bull, you\'ll be ready to leave the practice pen and compete in single-player career mode or in the head-to-head, cowboy-vs.-bull multiplayer mode. <P>Nevertheless, you\'ll discover one of the most impressive things about Professional Bull Rider even before you being to master its gameplay. And that\'s how accurately it portrays its subject, from the sizable roster of real PBR riders and bulls, to the not-so-subtle plethora of ads for cowboy-related products. After playing even a few rounds or watching any of a number of included FMV sequences, you\'ll witness moments during rides that are truly astounding; yet each is lent a gritty, realistic feel, thanks to the up-close, in-the-ring camera angles that are the hallmark of the actual TV broadcasts of the sport. And don\'t be fooled by the absurd writing on the game\'s box: Though Professional Bull Rider stars hall-of-famer Tuff Hedeman and Ty Murray, ""7-Time World Champion and All-Around Cowboy,"" these two gentleman don\'t swagger, exaggerate their accents, or put on any sort of show for your amusement. They instead narrate the tutorials by themselves, as themselves, presenting riding tips and knowledgeable descriptions of tricks for cowboys and bulls in a manner that\'s both down-to-earth and quietly dignified. <P>Once you get past the options and menu screens, you\'ll dive into the ring as a cowboy or a bucking bronco. Either way, you\'re in for a visual treat. If you let your eyes wander, you\'ll notice that the polygonal bulltenders and the bitmapped crowds are completely static and look quite bad - you may even wonder where in the heck the rodeo clowns are, since there aren\'t any in the actual gameplay arena. But you won\'t let your eyes wander. You\'ll be focusing squarely on the eager bull and the poised cowboy, who fly out of the gate with conviction as soon as the nod is given. Both the bull and cowboy are superbly animated and move so quickly and so realistically that it\'ll be impossible to take your eyes off either. And should your rider get bucked off a particularly ornery bull that manages to trample or charge him, your cowboy will either get caught up under the bull\'s hooves and stomped, slammed unceremoniously into the dirt, or flung high into the air, sometimes smack-dab into the fence. No time or trouble was spared in making such situations look exquisitely excruciating. Calamities like these will definitely go over well with fans of the ""ooh, that\'s gotta hurt"" sports moment. <P>Professional Bull Rider looks realistic and sounds about as convincing. The angry snorts of the bull in the pen are a perfect setup for that brutally meaty thud when it crashes into the hapless cowboy that just got bucked off. And all that bucking and twisting sounds even better thanks to the expert commentary by PBR caller Justin McKee. Though some of Mr. McKee\'s calls get a bit repetitive in certain situations, the commentary is quite good overall and helps make Professional Bull Rider feel less like a sit-down computer game and more like a live televised rodeo. <P>Professional Bull Rider is an offbeat but nonetheless great sports game that successfully treads the line between orthodox simulation and arcade action, thanks to its simple, responsive controls, realistic gameplay, and excellent animation - and it comes at a low, low price too. Some players may grow weary of pulling off the same bull and cowboy moves again and again after playing for some time, but Professional Bull Rider\'s got enough eight-second bursts of excitement to make it last for at least a little while. --<i>Andrew Seyoon Park</i><BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

623,Hellfire: Diablo Expansion,"['Build on the terror and adventure of <i>Diablo</i> with this expansion set. The software adds 12 new weapons, five new spells, 29 new foes, and the Monk, a new and powerful ally. There is also a whole new story to unravel and new demons to destroy.', 'To the surprise of many gamers, instead of releasing an expansion pack for Diablo, Blizzard North decided to focus its efforts on a full-fledged sequel (which has tentatively been given the appropriate, if unoriginal, title Diablo II). But gamers have continued to clamor for more Diablo, and eventually the expansion pack torch was passed to Blizzard\'s affiliate, Synergistic Software. Synergistic\'s Hellfire gives gamers new levels, monsters, items, spells, and single-player quests and refinements to the original Diablo engine, but the overall package is slightly less compelling than the original game. <P> As with Diablo, Hellfire\'s storyline is not particularly deep - Na\'Krul, a demon that once ranked highly in Diablo\'s hierarchy until turning on his master, is released from exile by ye local foolhardy mage. Na\'Krul and his cronies set up shop in eight new levels that fit seamlessly into the original game. These eight new levels are divided into two areas, each with its own new tileset, the gothic Demon Crypt (home sweet home for Na\'Krul) and the Festering Nest, an organic hive-like domain that hosts Na-Krul\'s ""Starship Troopers-refugee"" lieutenant, the Defiler. In addition to these new threats, you must once again deal with the big guy, Diablo, who returns more powerful than ever. <P> Although all the new monsters are confined to the new Hellfire levels, once you install Hellfire, you can find new items and shrines scattered throughout the original 16 levels of Diablo. You can use a new character class, the Monk, to conquer the challenges in the original game. The new Hellfire levels are roughly equivalent in difficulty to levels nine through 16 of the original game, which means you must either transfer a high-level character from the old game (through a needlessly cumbersome process), download one of the characters that has been made available at Sierra\'s web site, or trudge through the old levels with a new character if you want to survive the new levels. In addition to the new character class, items, and shrines, Hellfire provides a number of refinements to Diablo\'s gameplay - you can now jog instead of merely sauntering around town, cast spells to quickly find an exit to a level or to locate a tiny ring that you vaguely heard drop nearby, and can buy more useful items from the town\'s ever-greedy merchants. Synergistic has also added difficulty levels into the single-player version of the game, a feature inexplicably lacking from the original game. Gamers who are still playing Diablo will definitely appreciate these enhancements more than those who put Diablo back on the shelf long ago. <P> The most notable absence from Hellfire is multiplayer support, an especially surprising omission considering that Diablo is one of the most popular multiplayer games of all time. Given the amount of player hacking the original game underwent, it\'s not surprising that an unofficial hack has already appeared to let you use the Monk character class in a multiplayer game (but not on Battle.net, Blizzard\'s free Internet server). Future hacks may succeed in making the new levels and monsters accessible in a multiplayer game, but such hacks won\'t receive official sanction or support. For now, you\'ll be forced to play the new levels solo, which is reason enough for a significant portion of Diablo\'s fans to stay away from this expansion pack. <P> Hellfire includes a couple dozen new enemies, over 30 new magic items, seven new spells, and a handful of relatively simple new quests. The Monk character class is a very powerful fighter-mage. In addition to being a formidable spell-caster, the Monk is an adept martial artist who can use a staff to attack multiple opponents at once and is skilled in unarmed combat (yep, now you can kick Diablo in the head). The new spells include a healthy mix of defensive enchantments, devastating new offensive weapons (the original game\'s most powerful spells, Apocalypse and Nova, are now also available as spell books), and spells that just make wandering through the labyrinths more convenient. <P> Unlike the original game, most new monsters are represented by original artwork and are not just differently colored and powered variations of monsters previously used in the game. But there\'s a price to be paid for all the new art, as the monster animations and death sequences, in particular, appear to be less detailed than those included in the original game (although there are some great additions, such as the Liches, Crypt Demons, and Orbs). The new Demon Crypt tileset works well and is as detailed as any of the four tilesets in Diablo, but the Festering Nest tileset is a bit too disorienting and cluttered. There are, however, some nice graphical touches. For example, the barrels that appeared throughout the original game are replaced in the Festering Nest levels with organic body-snatcher-ish pods and by suitably gothic urns in the Demon Crypt. Hellfire adds some impressive new spell effects, such as huge glowing fireballs. The new levels also come with their own musical scores, which mainly consist of ambient sounds and don\'t measure up to the quality of the music in the original game. <P> Hellfire fails to provide as compelling an experience as Diablo, but does provides a good quantity of new monsters, items, spells, and settings, and a number of gameplay enhancements that eliminate a few annoyances of the original game. These additions and enhancements may not be sufficient to breathe new life into the original game, but if you are a single-player Diablo addict, Hellfire will enhance your enjoyment of Diablo. Hellfire is definitely more of the same, but that\'s not necessarily a bad thing, considering that Diablo was GameSpot\'s 1996 Game of the Year. Multiplayer aficionados, however, should pass on Hellfire. <i>--Desslock</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

631,Close Combat III: The Russian Front,"['Set on the Eastern Front -the greatest struggle in history - the game spans the 1941 invasion of the Soviet Union through the gates of Moscow, the factory complex of Stalingrad, to the 1945 fall of Berlin. The game features real-time, historically accurate warfare at a squad level along with psychological elements for maximum authenticity. Playing either the German or Soviet side, gamers are challenged to out- think and out-fight their opponent while keeping their troops alive. They start as low-ranking commanders and manage unit upgrade and maintenance as they attempt to advance in rank and acquire more troops and equipment.', 'At first glance, Close Combat IIII seems a lot like Close Combat II, which in itself is not a terrible thing. The game runs comfortably on older hardware, and thankfully Atomic hasn\'t jumped on the ""every game needs to be 3D"" bandwagon that has become so pervasive in the industry. Graphically it looks just like Close Combat II with photo-realistic terrain and smoothly animated units. The sound effects seem a tad bit weaker than in previous games. They still sound great, but Close Combat III doesn\'t have quite the symphony of death as the previous installment. It could be because the fighting is more spread out, thanks to the larger maps. The size of the maps, which are three times the size of Close Combat II\'s battlefields, is the first real gameplay difference you\'ll notice. They give you more room for maneuvering but at the expense of a lot of hurrying up and waiting. The first general difference you\'ll notice is the enormous scale of the game. Instead of focusing on one operation, Close Combat III focuses on the entire Eastern Front from 1941 to 1945. This opens up a huge array of weapon platforms and troops for dealing death, and hey, variety is always a good thing in a game. <P> The interface hasn\'t changed drastically but has been improved. No longer is a quarter of the screen taken up by the status bar. Instead, a single bar informs you of everything you need to know, though it only concentrates on one unit at a time. There is also an option to expand the bar to include all your forces. Right clicking on a unit brings up the command list, which now includes the ""ambush"" command. Ambush sets your troops to hide and come out only if the enemy is extremely close. This command and the ""defend"" command are direction sensitive - a feature that is new to the series. Changing directional facing is handled well. Click on a unit with the ambush or defend command, and a circle appears around it, with an arc highlighting its facing. Drag the arc to where you want the unit to face and click again. This is also helpful in positioning idle tanks so they don\'t expose their weak sides to the enemy. <P> Several new gameplay elements have been added. No longer do you have to worry about your troops choosing the most open terrain when you order them to move. Your units can be assigned to move via a series of waypoints, allowing you to pick the most advantageous route. Several new features are borrowed from resource-gathering real-time strategy games such as group numbering, drag selecting, and status bars above the unit. At first they might seem like a gimmick or some sort of attempt to make the Close Combat series appeal to a wider audience. Thankfully the inclusion of these features doesn\'t mean it has been dumbed down for the mass market. In fact, you\'ll come to realize that they add immensely to the experience.<P> Close Combat III allows you to duke it out against live opponents or the excellent AI in single scenarios, operations (a series of linked scenarios), custom-made scenarios, or campaigns. The game really earns its stripes in the campaign mode. Here you start with a small number of units that garner experience as the war drags on. The more battles you win, the higher in rank you go and the more troops you can command. Something new to the series is the inclusion of varying qualities of troops. Now you can choose from conscripts, standard, or elite forces. This really changes the way you plan battles, especially if you\'re leading a horde of conscripts. In between battles you can rest your forces, refit them with different equipment, or retire them out of the campaign. <P> If you\'ve never played a Close Combat game before, the battles will probably be quite a shock. You should expect Saving Private Ryan and not Rambo. Some of your troops will become heroes; others will run shrieking from the enemy. The perfect assault will be broken up by that antitank gun you didn\'t see. You might have expected the enemy to have no tanks, only to find a large contingency of them thundering down on your line. A key leader will die by sniper fire at the most inopportune moment. Unlike other wargames, you won\'t find your units reduced to attack/defense/movement numbers. There are no hexes, nor are there turns. It\'s all played in real time, with each shell computed individually, and morale playing a key role. <P> There are a few complaints, though they should be viewed like winning a Porsche and not liking the color; these aren\'t problems per se but rather elements that could have been altered to make the experience even better. First on the list is the way artillery is handled. Off-board artillery finally makes an appearance, but it\'s limited to one type for either side, and the player has no control over it. Being able to buy salvos of various types before a scenario would have been great. Next, you can forget about a Henschel Hs 129 swooping down to devastate Russian armor with its 30mm MK 101 gun. Tac air is once again left out. Finally, the campaigns take place on the same maps as the single battles, which allows you to essentially practice the campaign. It would have been nice to have no prior knowledge of the maps, forcing tactics on the fly. <P> Close Combat III: The Russian Front is the best Close Combat game of the bunch and personally probably the best wargame to grace your hard drive ever. Like that new album, at first it doesn\'t seem to differ greatly from previous works. Some of the new features appear to have been thrown in just to follow the trend. Play it enough, and you\'ll discover all the subtleties that make Close Combat III the magnum opus it is. All developers should look to Atomic Games when making a sequel. Atomic always keeps what works and expands on it with plenty of fresh material. If you want a wargame that tests your tactical skills more than your arithmetic skills, this is that game. It\'s challenging, engrossing, and shows that you don\'t need a P2 450 with two Voodoo 2s in SLI to have a good time. <i>--Scott R. Krol</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

632,Microsoft Entertainment Pack Puzzle Collection - PC,"['Power up your gray matter for The Puzzle Collection - featuring games by Alexey Pajitnov, the Russian mastermind behind Tetris.', ""Puzzle games have changed remarkably little over the years. Targeting the widest possible spectrum of users and machines, puzzle games skew towards the lowest common denominator in terms of control complexity and system requirements. The result has been a marked lack of innovation in the genre - most of today's puzzle games bear more than a passing resemblance to titles released five or even ten years ago."", ""In the absence of flashy graphics, immersive sound, or breakthrough technology, the only distinguishing factor between one puzzle game and another is gameplay. That's good news for gaming purists, but bad news for puzzle game designers, as it puts their new creations up against the best games in the genre, even if they were released years ago. This is why you'll almost never read a review of a puzzle game that doesn't mention Tetris - although released in the mid-80s it's still the standard by which all new puzzle games are judged."", ""Needless to say, Tetris is a difficult game to match - even if you're Alexey Pajitnov, Tetris' original designer. Not that he hasn't tried: Pajitnov has designed or endorsed dozens of games subsequent to Tetris, but none of them have even come close to matching the appeal or success of that seminal work."", ""And now he's at it again. Following the end of an association with MicroProse, Pajitnov has returned to the scene via Microsoft's Puzzle Collection. The disc includes ten all-new puzzle games, some of which were designed by Pajitnov, although it's never made clear exactly which ones. This may just be an oversight. Then again, it may not be. Based on the quality of the games on the disc, it would be a surprise if anyone, let alone Pajitnov, would be in a hurry to take credit for them."", 'Not everything in the collection is bad. Rat Poker, which challenges you to create ""hands"" of rats by catching them using manually activated traps, is highly original and reasonably entertaining. Another bright spot is Lineup, a turn-based game that requires you to manipulate variously shaped objects in order to create vertical or horizontal lines (imagine Tetris in quicksand, and you\'ve got the idea). Mixed Genetics, which asks you to breed triplet sets of mutant creatures in order to create a pure breed, plays better than it sounds, and is quite fun once you get the hang of it.', ""But beyond that, it's a slippery slope straight into puzzle hell. Of the remaining seven games, four (Spring Weekend, Finty Fush, Charmer, and Jewel Chase) are decidedly mediocre, with marginal appeal and limited replay value - frankly, they seem more appropriate for a shareware CD-ROM than a retail product from the world's most powerful software company. As for the remaining three games (Fringer, Color Collision, and Muddled Casino), suffice it to say that the first is extremely tedious, the second isn't even a puzzle game, and the third is muddled, indeed."", 'To top it all off, whether good, bad, or mediocre, none of The Puzzle Collection games includes a two-player mode (either competitive or cooperative). For those who enjoy two-player matches - whether in Tetris, Baku Baku, or Bust-a-Move 2 - this is a major omission.', ""Bottom line?

633,Microsoft Pandora's Box - PC,"[""Seven mythical tricksters escape from Pandora's Box to wreak havoc on the world. Thus begins a journey that includes 10 designs and 350 puzzles. It's up to you to solve them, capture the tricksters, and save the world from chaos. Solve 3-D puzzles specially designed for the computer. The puzzles don't require a lot of time to learn, yet they are progressively challenging to master. An overall mission provides a purpose for completing the puzzles. Game-play options allow you to follow the game's story line or jump directly to your favorite puzzle."", 'Alexei Pajitnov\'s name will forever be linked to Tetris, arguably the best puzzle game of all time. Luckily, the accomplishment of designing what is probably the most addictive game ever overshadows his recent track record, which includes mediocre selections such as Microsoft Puzzle Collection and a string of mediocre games for MicroProse, including Knight Moves and Qwirks, a poor PC adaptation of the excellent Puyo Puyo. <P>Pajitnov\'s latest, Pandora\'s Box, is a welcome return to form. While not quite as mind-and-finger-numbingly addictive as the game he is famous for, it still makes for a fun diversion. <P>Pandora\'s Box isn\'t actually a single game, but rather a collection of ten different puzzle types. For the most part, each type is a variation on the jigsaw puzzle, and some are more fun than others. In each puzzle, you must arrange the pieces to complete a picture or an object. What the pieces are, and what you need to do to arrange them properly, differs from puzzle to puzzle. <P>The puzzle types themselves range from renovated versions of old favorites, such as Rotoscope, a circular slider puzzle, to innovative variations like Outer Layer, which requires you to place the textures on a 3D object such as a vase or a sculpture. Other puzzles types are a bit more typical. Overlap is a straightforward jigsaw puzzle; the only difference is that the pieces can, as the name suggests, overlap. Slices is simply a vertical jigsaw puzzle that requires you to stack pieces of a 3D object. And Focus Point, the best of the lot, requires you to assemble out-of-focus pieces of an image. <P>There are also two puzzle types that stray from the jigsaw formula. Image Hole, probably the least interesting puzzle in the game, involves a covered picture. Shapes move around the board, revealing the image as they pass over. Your goal is to line up the shape with its corresponding portion of the picture underneath. It sounds interesting, but the shapes are too vague to make it anything more than frustrating most of the time. The other non-jigsaw puzzle is Find and Fill. In this puzzle, you are presented with a picture with sections missing and a separate jumble of shapes. You must use a simple paint program to find and fill the shapes that are missing from the picture. It\'s fun, but the picture that\'s provided for reference is so tiny the puzzle often ends up being nothing more than a guessing game. <P>What makes Pandora\'s Box more interesting than just a puzzle anthology is its attempt to give meaning to the proceedings. The story follows the basics of the Greek myth from which the game takes its name. Pandora has unleashed chaos - in the form of seven trickster gods - into the world, and you must recapture them. To do this, you must solve puzzles. What\'s intriguing is that the jigsaw nature of the puzzles fits the theme somewhat - you must restore order to chaos by piecing together fragments of puzzles into a whole - and your overall sense of purpose, even if it\'s the most basic ""find the stuff"" premise, is rare for the genre. <P>You must capture the seven tricksters: mythological and religious figures such as Eris, Puck, and Coyote. You pursue each of them to several cities, each of which has ten puzzles. Under one of the puzzles is a piece of the box. There are four pieces associated with each of these mischievous spirits, and once you have obtained all four pieces from one, you then go after the trickster himself. Once you\'ve captured him, you move on to the next trickster, the next set of cities, and the next set of puzzles. There\'s a lot to do and a lot of puzzles to solve. The escalating difficulty and the slow introduction of new puzzle types help to keep things interesting. <P>Pandora\'s Box isn\'t the Half-Life of puzzle games, but it is revolutionary in a sense. It\'s not only a great way to divert yourself for short periods of time, but the overall sense of accomplishment you\'ll feel when you complete a series of its puzzles makes it something you\'ll go back to time and time again. And while the individual pieces may be a bit weak on their own, the overall experience is satisfying and worthwhile.<I>--Ron Dulin</I><br>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Race actual cars on real-world courses throughout North America and Europe. Tune and customize you car for ultimate performance, then compete against computer-controlled opponents designed to simulate the driving styles of the real-life drivers.', 'Remember Chuck Yeager\'s Air Combat? All right, maybe not - and even if you do you\'re probably wondering what on God\'s green earth a dated WWII air-combat game has to do with an auto-racing sim. So I\'ll clear things up for you with a little homespun aphorism that more game developers should take to heart: If it feels real, it is real. Chuck Yeager\'s flat polygons might look bland today, but when I saw them from a virtual cockpit eight years ago I felt as if I really were in the skies above war-torn Europe - a lot like the way I feel when I start a race of Sports Car GT and am nearly as excited, tense, and focused as if I were on the start line at Laguna Seca in an exquisite road racer. <P> Admittedly, Sports Car GT doesn\'t dish up the most jaw-dropping graphics you\'ve ever seen (though they are good), and its modeling of car and engine damage will leave a lot of sports-car fans wishing that real life were as forgiving. But make no mistake: When you slam the pedal to the floor and kick one of these high-priced monsters into first gear, you will feel like you\'re out on the track bumping and scraping with the big boys. The 3D modeling here is so good, so convincing, that you\'ll find yourself in a severe fit of road rage when a driver cuts you off at a curve or some idiot spins out and blocks that perfect line you\'d been following for the last three laps. <P> Fans of high-dollar sports cars will find that the menu in Sports Car GT is enough to set their mouths watering, with cars from BMW, McLaren, Porsche, Panoz, Vector, Mosler, Callaway, Lister, and Ford (the Saloon Mustang). And the settings are more than good enough for these fancy entrees - the game boasts world-famous courses such as MoSport Park, Road Atlanta, Laguna Seca, Donnington, Hockenheim, and Lime Park, along with a trio of fictional tracks that stand up pretty well on their own merits. Perhaps the reproductions of the real-life tracks aren\'t 100 percent genuine, but not a lot of folks are going to spot the discrepancies - and even if they did, they couldn\'t deny that this sim delivers the spirit, if not the letter, of what it\'s like to scream down these legendary circuits. And if you stick with it long enough, you\'ll start seeing famous names like Brabham, Pilgrim, O\'Connell, and Bernard in the field. <P> I could rave about graphical effects like accurate mirrors, roiling smoke from spinouts, the way computer-controlled drivers have an uncanny tendency to make mistakes at crucial moments (just like we lowly humans do), or how the multitude of car setup options are both easy to understand and actually affect how fast your rig makes a lap. I could rattle on about how a replay reveals that your car\'s chassis shifts to reflect ""inertial forces"" (that means that you can see it rise up as you crest a hill or see it sway to the left or right when you\'re making a powerslide through a tight turn). But none of that means squat if the game doesn\'t deliver that precious adrenaline rush when you\'re out on the track - and if you don\'t get that feeling when you\'re driving in this game, you\'ll probably never get it. <P> Hold on a minute. I forgot to tell you how this beast that\'s been sucking up all my spare time actually works. Sports Car GT lets you hop into those fancy cars for quick races (a mere two cars and four tracks at the start of the game), enter a career mode (win money and add better equipment for handling, braking, suspension, etc.), or race against other people in a multiplayer game (but unfortunately there\'s no support for a matching service like the Internet Gaming Zone or even a chat area to exchange IP addresses). <P> Perfect as it seems, though, Sports Car GT doesn\'t get everything right. The bulk of the gripes stem from the fact that this game was made for both consoles and PCs (with different developers, however), and EA was apparently striving to make the two versions as similar as possible. You\'ll find many console-style quirks in Sports Car GT, some more annoying than others depending on your idiosyncrasies. There aren\'t global settings for generic stuff like graphics, sound, realism, replay settings, and so on (you have to adjust them for each driver you create); a huge majority of the tracks and cars are locked out until you log enough winning performances in career mode (unless you hack or cheat); and the lack of a true save-game feature means you can easily wreck a career unless you make careful choices when buying cars and equipment. The biggest disappointment is that unless Sports Car GT develops a dedicated fan base, the only official way to find opponents is by posting your name on EA\'s lame and relatively ineffective Multiplayer Matchup (I put my name up a year ago for Madden \'99 and NHL Hockey \'99 and have received only one response). <P> The good news is that Sports Car GT is so downright addictive that you can easily overlook these shortcomings. The game demands a lot in PC horsepower - my guess is something around a 333MHz with a ton of RAM and a really good 3D card - but if you\'ve got it then you haven\'t got any reason not to give this game a spin unless you hate racing games. And if that\'s the case, then there\'s this old WWII flight sim called Chuck Yeager\'s Air Combat that you might want to check out. <i>--Chris Gregson</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

640,F-22 Lightning 3 - PC,"['The bestselling jet combat simulation of 1996 and 1997 is back. <i>F-22 Lightning 3</i> takes modern jet combat to a new level with the fiercest action and most stunning graphics ever conceived. Owners of 3-D cards will be delighted to know that <i>F-22 Lightning 3</i> is scheduled to support an extensive array of 3-D hardware including both Glide and Direct3D technologies. <i>Lightning 3</i> promises electrifying gameplay and innovative enhancements to the most powerful F-22 flight simulator available. Including over 50 new, gripping single-player missions, <i>Lightning 3</i> offers intense online multiplayer combat through NovaWorld. Acclaimed as the leader in large-scale multiplayer gaming, NovaLogic is proud to introduce Voice-Over-Net technology, which allows pilots to talk to each other during the heat of combat.', ""Since the early days of NovaLogic - you know, back when voxels were the size of your fist and hours were wasted trying to squeeze out some extra lower memory to run Comanche - the company has steadily released simulations, typically with a military theme, that are fast, fun, and furious. You didn't expect a lot of realism or even depth in some cases, but what you got was a game you could load, play, and shoot something in, with some nice explosion or other graphical treat as your reward. Despite NovaLogic's attempt to gain legitimacy with official sanctioning from the F-22's manufacturer Lockheed Martin, you still couldn't expect the level of realism of, say, the Falcon series, or sims from Digital Integration, Jane's, or Digital Image Design. So, with that in mind, if you look over NovaLogic's latest offering, F-22 Lightning 3, you are presented with NovaLogic's credo (that is, fast, fun, and furious) front and center, which is really not a bad thing at all. <P> F-22 Lightning III is a fairly straightforward, easy-to-play, simple-to-get-into F-22 flight simulation, featuring good graphics and mission structure, as well as a more pronounced emphasis on fast and furious multiplayer games. You can step up the screen resolution all the way to 1024x768, though 800x600 runs fine for 3dfx owners (recommended, as the HUD is easier to read in the full cockpit mode). Hardware requirements are surprisingly lax - 800x600 on a Voodoo2 is extremely smooth with all the options turned on. Then again the price you pay is the fog, which seems to be too close for comfort, diminishing how far you can see onto the horizon. One nice graphical feature is the variety of weather: snow, thunderstorms, driving rain, and so forth. The lightning is a particularly good effect, not to mention the nuclear explosions (more on those babies later). The aircraft are well detailed and sport a variety of paint schemes. <P> That brings us to gameplay, which is pretty simplified and easy to learn. Many of the controls are standard, borrowing from previous NovaLogic flight sims in more than a few areas. Many extra commands can be accessed directly through various though somewhat unusual key combinations, mostly through the use of the control key. You can customize your controls for the keyboard and joystick to whatever you want. You'll spend most of your time in the HUD or virtual cockpit views, or slewing to the padlock in between. There are external views, including a target view, all of which can be tilted and/or panned, but they are hardly intuitive or action-oriented. Typically everything you need to know is in the HUD, though when the missiles start flying it would be better to switch to the virtual cockpit for a gander at the radar view. Missions are objective- and waypoint-oriented, so you basically fly your route and attempt to accomplish the goal - blowing something up, shooting something down, or trying not to get yourself or your buddies killed. <P> Combat is easy - as soon as you are within range, directional cues and other indicators will tell you what it is and where it's going. All the standard weapon types are here: AMRAAMs, sidewinders, your trusty 20mm Vulcan Gatling gun, HARMs, JDAMs, various types of iron bombs, and everyone's favorite B61 10-kiloton tactical thermonuclear free-fall bomb. Why in the world an F-22 would be carrying one is beyond me, but it's fun to drop the bomb and ride the shock wave. One departure from most F-22 sims is not having to worry about opening the weapon bay doors before releasing your ordnance - all of the F-22's weapons are stored in internal weapon bays - and closing them again after launch to reduce your radar signature. It's all done for you. Heck, you hardly even have to worry about your radar signature. <P> F-22 Lightning 3 has three modes of play: quick missions, campaigns, and multiplayer. The quick missions are not instant action, a feature that was surprisingly left out. Actually the quick missions are a set of training and situational missions, set first in Nevada and then moving overseas. They can be played in any order, but they are arranged in a tutorial-like manner from the beginning, and the complexity rises with each successive mission. There are 22 quick missions, and more can be created via an external mission editor that comes with the game, which is another nifty feature. <P> There are six campaigns, with a total of 46 missions split between them (each campaign features either seven or eight missions, which must be played in order). The campaigns cover various hot spots around the world (Libya, Chad, Indonesia, Syria, the Kola Peninsula, and so forth). Difficulty varies, though the missions aren't nearly as difficult as some in F-22 Lightning II, but the campaigns should be played in the order they appear. Some of the missions can get tricky but not overly head-banging-against-the-wall hard. <P> Then there's multiplayer: Click to enter the NovaWorld.net servers, pick a game, and off you go. Typically there are three game types (more may be introduced later): deathmatch, RAW, and cooperative. Deathmatch is pretty self-explanatory, though the games can be made with full ordnance loads or guns only. In RAW, teams attempt to bomb their enemy's base off the map before the same happens to their own base, while in cooperative games you can participate with up to seven other players in specially built missions (the other game modes support a whopping 128 players). NovaWorld games are typically a blast to play in, and latency is not a big issue - low-speed modems play just as well as cable modems. To make things even more interesting, NovaLogic threw a microphone headset in the box to accommodate its new Voice-Over-Net technology, letting you communicate with each other using voice transmissions while flying. And it works, too. <P> So what does F-22 Lightning 3 have going against it? For one thing the simplicity may turn off some of the more die-hard flight-sim fanatics. NovaLogic also applied the same simplicity to its game manual, a 38-page travesty that is short on explanation and long on nothing in particular. Well, OK, it does devote a significant length to taking off and landing, even in-flight refueling, but what about air combat basics or even flying and aerodynamics? Actually there is an Adobe Acrobat file on the CD-ROM about air combat, but this is the kind of stuff that should have been in the manual. Throw in a couple of other annoying tidbits for good measure, like no instant action, set mission structures with no randomization, and bland view options, and F-22 Lightning 3 ends up not quite all it might have been. <P> Overall, though, NovaLogic has churned out a pretty good flight simulation that does its job well. It's an F-22 flight simulation where you can jump into the cockpit, fly for a minute or two, and hop straight into the action, and it provides a variety of missions and multiplayer options that other sims will find difficult to compete against. <i>--Alan Dunkin</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

643,Microsoft Return of Arcade - PC,"['Relive those carefree and exciting days when every quarter burned a hole in your pocket. Return of Arcade puts you in command of four hot arcade classics --- replicated exactly for the PC!', 'Hark back to 1982. Of course, that may be a pre-embryonic hark for many gamers, but bear with me. This was the apex of the video arcade\'s golden age. Back then arcade aficionados piled quarters on popular machines to ""hold"" their station. Parents urged boycotts and feared for a lost generation. Lines of eager gamers snaked out from popular titles. And those titles invariably included the four games in Microsoft\'s Return of Arcade: Pac-Man, Dig Dug, Pole Position, and Galaxian. <P> Back then, computers simply could not compete with arcade machines\' dedicated audio and video processors. My Apple II+ versions of Galaxian and Pac-Man paled in comparison to the ""real"" things. The allure of the arcade was overwhelming. <P> Today, you can experience that golden age of arcades at home. Microsoft has done an excellent job re-engineering these games to run in Windows 95. Its programmers worked closely with Namco, the games\' designer and still one of the top arcade game makers in the world. Microsoft could have beefed up the sound and graphics but remained faithful to original, albeit weak, eight-bit audio and 16 colors. Not a detail seems to have been forgotten, not even the built-in, but known-only-to-insiders playing tricks. <P> For those who don\'t know, Galaxian came out in 1979 and is a back-and-forth scrolling space shooter. Pac-Man hit the arcades in 1980 and became the most popular arcade game ever. The allure of a little pizza face gobbling ghosts appealed to all ages and both sexes. And Pole Position, a simple auto racing sim, and Dig Dug, a nearly indescribable, underground, demon quest, were both released in 1982. <P> So are these old games worth your time and money? For nostalgia buffs, the answer\'s a definite yes, though you will miss the feel of the arcade controller. Keyboard controls, especially for Pole Position, just don\'t cut it. A joystick is a must and it\'s still not the real thing. <P> For those not raised on these games the answer is a qualified yes. They offer hours of wonderfully retro distraction but lack the visceral feel and rich depth of today\'s games. <P> Hmm. I catch the scent of a new, old trend: simple, readily accessible games, offering brief, coffee-break-length entertainment. And this time, you don\'t have to leave your office to enjoy them. <i>--Jeff Sengstack</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

645,Interstate '76: Arsenal - PC,"[""<I>Interstate '76 Arsenal</I> contains two award-winning, action-packed games. The Gold Edition includes original missions and battles with upgraded features, such as an optimized engine for increased performance. The Nitro gives you new multiplayer maps and novelty vehicles, including an ambulance. This package combines two great games with new weapons, vehicles, and missions."", ""Last year's Interstate '76 was one of the best games of the pre-summer season. A vehicular combat simulation with an original storyline and a well-developed atmosphere, I76 made it a little easier to weather the dry spell that traditionally follows the holiday season. But it wasn't without its problems. There was a somewhat sluggish engine, strange bugs, and a noticeable lack of 3D-accelerator support. And while the newly released Interstate '76 Arsenal addresses the latter, the other problems are even more noticeable now that the game is a year old. <P> The Arsenal combines two products: Interstate '76 Gold Edition (a 3D-accelerated version of the original) and Nitro Pack (a collection of new single-player missions and multiplayer maps, which is also available separately from Activision's web site). Because GameSpot has already reviewed the original (see the link under related games), there's no need to go into too much detail here. Suffice to say, if you haven't played through it already, the game is still well worth your time, and the Nitro Pack missions are a nice bonus in the deal. But if you've already played I76, it's a much more difficult decision. <P> To say the least, the Nitro Pack is a little disappointing on the single-player side. The new missions, while fun, are missing the challenge and the sense of purpose that made it easy to look past I76's faults. There's no story, no cutscenes. It is simply a collection of unrelated missions in which you play as three of the characters from the original: Taurus, Jade, and Skeeter (and if you finish all of their missions, you can play a handful of missions as a brand-new character). As in the stand-alone scenarios included in the original, you can choose any car and any weapons configuration in these missions; there's no salvaging and no need to worry about taking too much damage. As a result, they are far too easy. And while some of the new missions are creative, you can't help but wish there were some overarching story to tie them all together. <P> On the multiplayer side, there are some nice additions. There are new cars and weapons, the ability to limit which weapons are admissible in a game, and enhanced protection against hacked cars. The game is by no means hack-proof, though, and in my few ventures onto Activision's servers I noticed a few suspiciously resilient foes and a great number of braggarts claiming to have hacked vehicles. The most notable addition to the multiplayer game, though, is the new capture-the-flag mode that adds a great deal more strategy and fun than the traditional kill fests of old. There are still a few features that Activision's servers could use, such as pings and the ability to see how many players are on each side in team games. On the whole, though, connecting to a game and getting started is a trouble-free process. <P> As for the graphic enhancements, they are a mixed bag. The 3D support gives a noticeable frame rate boost and some nice new elements such as more detailed vehicles, accurate weapons display, and realistic sky effects. But don't expect awe-inspiring visuals. Even with the visibility set at its highest setting, you'll encounter an enormous amount of pop-up (so much so that it can actually become distracting), strange texture ripping (which is most notable with shadows), and even some annoying effects like 2D smoke and unspectacular explosions. <P> All in all, Interstate '76 Arsenal seems like a missed opportunity. So here comes a very complex recommendation: If you've never played I76, the Arsenal is a good bet; the excellent single-player campaign from the original combined with the new multiplayer options make for some really solid playing. If you're a fanatical I76 fan, you may want to pick up the Nitro Pack just to play through the eyes of some new characters, even if the lack of a campaign is a bit disappointing. But if you're somewhere in between, you should probably just keep your engine idling until a real sequel is released. <i>--Ron Dulin</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

(Ages 17 and older)"", ""Phantasmagoria is Sierra's first attempt at a full-blown, live-action, interactive video adventure, and their ambition far outweighs the results. A four-plus-million-dollar budget and over two years in production do not necessarily translate into high quality gaming."", 'Much of Phantasmagoria is spent on typical adventure activities: exploring, grabbing items, and problem solving. And on that level, the game is reasonably enjoyable. In addition, the graphics are excellent, the music is emotive, and there are many pleasant surprises. But problems arise in several areas: experienced adventurers will find Phantasmagoria generally unchallenging, the characters weak, the violence over-the-top, and the script just lame. For instance, during day one Adrienne discovers a secret chapel full of bizarre items yet doesnt think it important enough to tell her husband. On day two, she barely breaks a sweat over the fact that her hubby has transformed from a loving partner to a crazed lunatic.', 'Many of this titles problems come from complexities inherent in taking a huge concept and trying to wring a game out of it. Somebody forgot to do some detailed planning and fine-tuning. This is clear from the character interactions, the repetitive nature of some scenes, and the unrealistic puzzles--the telescope eyepiece ""glints"" in the sand only after you discover you need it, even though youve walked by that spot several times already.', ""So why is Phantasmagoria so darned popular? It's accessible to newbies, it's a new genre, and Sierra has promoted the hell out of it. The built-in hint system can turn this into a cakewalk and you'll be wowed by the occasional top notch production values. Unfortunately, the repetitive violence may turn the newcomers off just as quickly. My recommendation: Phantasmagoria is only for the gaming-challenged. Otherwise try Gabriel Knight: The Beast Within. It's Sierra's second big-time video adventure and they learned from their mistakes.<i>--Jeff Sengstack/SpotMedia Communications</i><br />--<i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

652,Shanghai: Dynasty - PC/Mac,"['<i>Shanghai: Dynasty</i> combines the addictive game play of ancient Chinese tile-matching games with the Internet to provide new challenges. This best-selling game generates both single and multiplayer puzzles, including mahjong. This puzzle-packed challenge sets off a new era in tile-matching excitement.', ""Mah-jongg, that ancient Chinese tile-matching game enjoyed the world over, may be one of the most widely played forms of recreation known to mankind. While not quite as old as the tabletop version, Shanghai: Dynasty - Activision's sixth take on the highly popular past time - may be the most ambitious of the computerized translations, integrating a wide array of significant enhancements into an already feature-rich and entertaining system."", 'First introduced eons ago in 1986, the latest entry in the long line of Shanghai products adds several important features and facets of play to the game\'s fairly fundamental concept. For instance, Shanghai: Dynasty now boasts multiplayer compatibility (offering IPX, modem, and Internet accessibility); several competitive single- and dual-player modes; ""Shanghai for Kids,"" a tailored version of the game that\'s ideally suited to teaching children the basics; a tournament mode; a custom tile and layout editor; and, for the first time, mah-jongg. Now you can hook up with fellow online enthusiasts and partake in a lively parlor session of mah-jongg, Classic Shanghai, or the all-new Dynasty and Pandemonium, two rather intriguing derivatives that breathe new life into this somewhat tired favorite. In Dynasty, you lock horns with up to four savvy computer-controlled opponents in a race to see who can clear their board in the quickest time. In an interesting twist, power tiles - in the form of jokers - have been added to the mix, which, when successfully matched, can cause tiles to be replaced on each of your opponent\'s boards or can locate matches on your own board. In Pandemonium, you again put your prowess to the ultimate test against up to four quick-witted computer-controlled opponents - this time, however, all of the players must compete on the same board, racing against the clock and each other to find and make the most matches before game\'s end. Several new, beautifully crafted tile sets have been developed - astrology, fantasy, prehistoric, and Egyptian hieroglyphics, to name but a few - complete with wondrous animations and exotic sound effects. For the truly adventurous, you may even create your own tile sets using MS Paint - which is incorporated into Windows 95 - and the special template contained within the BMP folder on the Shanghai CD. If you so desire, you may even upload or download your custom-designed tile sets or layouts with fellow Shanghai players, thereby expanding the number of tile sets. And, should you ""paint"" yourself into a corner, a handy ""shuffle"" option has also been included, which scrambles and repositions any unmatched tiles so that play may continue. As a reward for clearing the board, you receive positive predictions, similar to the kinds of messages contained within fortune cookies.', ""So, whether you have an entire afternoon or just a few minutes to kill, try kicking back and booting up Shanghai: Dynasty. It's the perfect respite for the rainy-day blues, combining all the rich, compelling elements of mah-jongg with the challenging interactivity and immediacy afforded by the Internet. Even if you don't have access to a modem, or you prefer to indulge in a solitaire session or two, Shanghai: Dynasty is an impressive and expansive take on the centuries-old classic. <i>--Marc Dultz</i> <br /><i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Because you haven\'t already spent $40 or $50 on the original Command & Conquer, you needn\'t worry whether or you should shell out another $45 or $50 for Windows 95 support, SVGA graphics, head-to-head Internet play, and a Command & Conquer Theme Pack (animated icons, wallpaper, and sound effects); after all, you\'re buying the game, not the extras. So you\'ll buy the Gold Edition and love it - case closed. <P>But what if you\'re one of the hundreds of thousands of users who already own the DOS version of Command & Conquer? Is it really worth $30 or $40 bucks (owners of the DOS version get a $10 rebate) for the enhancements? For gamers uninterested in multiplayer action, the answer is probably ""no."" The new graphics are a big improvement, but they\'re not enough to get you excited about fighting the same single-player battles over again. But if you\'re into multiplayer C&C, it\'s probably worth the investment. <P>Take the SVGA graphics, for instance. It would be easy to dismiss them as eye candy, but the truth is they allow you to see four times as much of the map as in the DOS version - giving you a decided edge when competing against players using the old C&C. And with the addition of Westwood Chat support, C&C fans have another venue for finding opponents and playing tournaments or ladder games. Setting up a game over Westwood Chat is about as easy as Internet gaming gets, and there are always plenty of opponents looking for action. <P>The one complaint many will have with the Gold Edition is price. Westwood has made a ton of money (and justifiably so) off the sales of Command & Conquer; to ask Command & Conquer owners to pay almost full price for an SVGA upgrade, Internet play, and Theme Pack is a bit much. New users will find the investment well worth it, but the company could create a lot more goodwill among their loyal fans by upping that rebate by five or ten bucks, or simply creating an upgrade. Especially when you consider that serious C&C players will consider those SVGA graphics essential for staying competitive in their multiplayer matches.<I>--Stephen Poole</I><br>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

659,Armored Fist 2 - PC,"[""The M1A2 Abrams is America's main battle tank. It is a 60-ton monster with a 1,500 horsepower engine that drives it at speeds up to 65 miles an hour. It can roll over a car like you roll over in bed. Its 120mm cannon can spit a shell of penetrating high-explosive shot 3000 meters, instantly destroying any piece of armor that any nation could field. The modern tank battles it was designed to fight are characterized by fast speeds and long distances. An enemy doesn't even know the Abrams is there until that round of HEAT comes through his turret. In the Gulf War it was not unusual to read of four M1A2s destroying three dozen Iraqi tanks in about twenty minutes, with the Abrams not suffering a scratch. The Iraqis couldn't count a single destroyed Abrams on their butcher's bill during the war. <P> All these things were in my mind as I loaded up Armored Fist 2 and set about exploring the world that NovaLogic had prepared for my entertainment. I began by attempting to drive my tank around and see the sites. There was a nice tutorial with an authoritative-sounding commander shouting orders in order to help me understand navigation, weapons handling, and combined-arms warfare. There were four speed settings I could use: stop, 1/4, 1/2, and full. Engaging any one of them immediately sent the tank on its proscribed course without any steering or input from me. When I did want to steer - say, to avoid a boulder that we were about to drive over - the speed setting disengaged and the tank stopped. My first lesson: Tank drivers can't steer and move ahead at half power at the same time. (They need to use a manual throttle control.) <P> But at least we were under way! I wanted to see what my new hi-tech M1 could do to the slightly chunky and woefully choppy scenery that NovaLogic had provided for me, so I started to drive over things. Well, that was the plan. Nothing, however, could be crushed, or even budged, by my 60-ton truck running at full speed. Not other tanks, not fuel storage, not trucks, not water towers, not even tents and netting. Only supply depots would blow up when I hit them. I wasn't thinking too highly of my new tank. Aren't large explosions supposed to ensue when a tank runs into, for instance, a tanker full of fuel? It was my first hint that all the hype about this M1A2 Abrams had been just that: hype. <P> A modern tank commander has state-of-the-art technology at his fingertips to survey the situation, communicate with the other tanks in his platoon, and deliver ordinance on target. A crew of four drives the tank, loads shot, fires the cannon, and monitors the hi-tech instruments. I didn't see any hi-tech instruments in my particular tank, and while I found that the crew handled themselves pretty well, the other tanks in my platoon were a positive disgrace: missing their targets and exposing themselves to fire. Maybe it was because I just didn't have the ability to give them proper orders: All I could do was set a formation and tell them to move, stop, fire, and don't fire. Heck, I couldn't even move a waypoint without replotting my entire course. Maybe it was my leadership that was poor, and not them... I began to feel a bit better about the Abrams when I opened fire with my machine gun. To my amazement, this rather humble device was so powerful that a short burst from it would level a three-story building! I hadn't realized that bullets could do that. Nor had I realized that a tracked vehicle could climb a 60-degree incline at well-nigh full speed. I was feeling good. My tank could do things no other tank could. This good feeling persisted right up until I got into some action. <P> That's right: There were foes to crush in Africa, The Soviet Union (I thought that didn't exist any more), Belarus, and someplace else. It doesn't matter. All the locations had the same washed out, chunky look to them, and all the missions (something like 50 of 'em) seemed to take place within a few hundred square yards. For a tank that's supposed to engage enemies from over a mile away, I found these close quarters cramping. It was also pretty disconcerting to have weaker enemies kill my tanks - tanks that have never suffered a battlefield loss - while my sabot and HEAT rounds bounced harmlessly off their shells. I soon grew bored with missions in faraway areas, because no matter what the goal or location or time of day, they all felt exactly the same and all took place in a small, confining areas. <P> It was a sore disappointment to me. I had been led to believe that Yankee know-how was the best in the world, yet here was a hi-tech armored vehicle that was half white elephant and half super machine, and not in the right halves. I didn't feel like I'd had fun with my tank. I just felt taken for a ride. And a bumpy one at that. <i>--Chet Thomas</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

660,Field &amp; Stream Ultimate Fishing Pack - PC,['This fishing game offers tips and techniques from real pros and simulated competition.']
661,Rollcage - PC,"['Rollcage gives you combat action with road racing in an explosive game. Drive your choice of six indestructible vehicles anywhere and on any surface. This next-generation road race includes no rules but high speed and nonstop racing.', 'You\'ve probably seen those radio-controlled cars you can bounce, flip, and spin because the top and bottom are identical; when they land after a jump, they start trucking just as soon as they get enough wheels touching the ground to create some traction. Now imagine that you could not only race a vehicle like that, but that you could also use it to ram anything that gets in your way - other cars, barricades, construction equipment, columns supporting massive buildings, you name it - without taking damage. Add a couple of mounts for weapons and special items like missiles, turbo speed, temporary wormholes, and even a tool that cuts off every competitor\'s engine, and you\'ve got a pretty good idea of what awaits you in Rollcage, an extremely cool arcade racer that does just about everything right. <P> Rollcage developer Attention to Detail obviously didn\'t spend a lot of time concocting a back story to explain why you and five other racers are raising all manner of hell on 20 futuristic tracks; all I figured out from the cryptic manual intro is that ""rollcagers"" are renegades who\'ve made a conscious effort to make their sport as violent as possible after it achieved widespread popularity. That could be viewed as a commentary on everything from music to art, but all I know for sure is that it gives gamers the chance to do stuff they never dreamed of in an arcade racer. <P> This isn\'t the first racing game that puts you behind the wheel of an armed vehicle, but Rollcage stands apart from the pack in several ways. Most racing games - even ones where you\'re shooting at other drivers - put a premium on keeping your car on the track as much as possible. In Rollcage, on the other hand, you can not only bounce and flip and always land wheel-side down, but you also can drive along walls and even on tunnel ceilings. You might wonder just why you\'d bother doing that, but sometimes it\'s the best way to pass an opponent, as well as the only way to grab certain power-ups. Then there\'s the whole notion of collisions. Sure, they slow you down, but hit the right object - a column supporting a building, for instance - and you\'ll be long gone as your opponent either gets buried in debris or runs smack-dab into a smoking heap of rubble. <P> Of course, you might prefer a more direct approach to slowing down your opponents, and that\'s where the power-ups scattered around each track come into play. Homing missiles automatically target the weakest part of structures, letting you bring the walls tumbling down without slowing your own car down; you can also target a vehicle in front of you and flip it out of control. The time warp slows down every car on the track except yours; leader missiles take out - you guessed it - the lead car; the driller bores through almost everything in its path; an ice sheet makes opponents lose nearly all their traction; and the wormhole lets you leapfrog past the car directly in front of you. And power-ups aren\'t limited to offensive weapons, either. Turbo boosts your speed until the scenery is just a blur, and the shield protects you from enemy weapons and decreases the chance of spinouts after collisions. <P> Just like in Motorhead, the relatively humdrum car graphics in Rollcage are more than compensated for by wonderfully detailed trackside scenery - assuming you\'ve got time to admire your surroundings while driving at breakneck speeds, that is. Vast cityscapes, barren volcanic wastelands, lush islands, and busy industrial sites are the sorts of settings you\'ll be racing on, and with the exception of some fairly cruddy 2D trees (common to nearly all arcade racers), the graphics work is top-notch. Even more visually impressive than the scenery are the weapons effects. Use the time warp, and the entire display begins to undulate and sway in a psychedelic haze; fire the leader missile, and you\'ll see brilliant trails of flames as it screams just above the track in search of the front-runner. My fave? The wormhole - it slowly advances on the car in front of you before engulfing it and removing it from your path. <P> You\'ll find all the usual race options here: League competition is the Rollcage equivalent of a season; arcade lets you race on almost all the game\'s 20 tracks; and time attack lets you try to top your own best lap times. A welcome feature is the inclusion of multiple difficulty levels; it takes considerable practice to learn how to handle a car that can drive upside down on a ceiling, but even the newest of newbies can compete on the game\'s easy setting. <P> Even on the easy setting, though, you\'ll run into one of the game\'s few drawbacks: You can get bashed around so much that sometimes you\'ll just want to throw up your hands in defeat. Picture driving bumper cars at 350kph, and you\'ve got a notion of just how disorientating the smash-bang action in Rollcage can be. Practice can help you avoid some of the show-stopping collisions, but even the best drivers can fall victim to multiple collisions and find themselves out of the running - unless they manage to lay their hands on a mighty power-up like the time warp or leader missile, that is, and even those probably won\'t take you from last to first if you\'re running at the highest difficulty setting. <P> Where Rollcage really disappoints, though, is in its multiplayer support. It\'s not that the game doesn\'t offer multiplayer modes - the full suite of connection options are supported, including TCP/IP and serial connections, and split-screen play is available for up to four players on a single system. The real problem is finding opponents: Because Rollcage isn\'t supported on services like Mplayer, HEAT, or the Internet Gaming Zone, about the only way to scare up some mano-a-mano action is to pray that someone on Kali has a copy of the game. Psygnosis should seriously consider providing at least a rudimentary matching service - a bulletin board for posting challenges or a chat room - so its customers can get the most out of their games. No matter how good the single-player game is, it\'s easy to envision just how much fun it would be to go up against human drivers. <P> Action hounds who like their driving spiced with some mayhem will definitely want to add this one to their shopping cart, but even if you\'re not a fan of this sort of fare, you ought to download the demo if only to see the brain-searing weapons effects and topsy-turvy action. And here\'s hoping that Psygnosis puts a little effort into making it easier to find someone to use that wormhole thingy on... <i>--Stephen Poole</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Just you, the game's greatest players, and the world's most magnificent golf courses. Play for fun or play to win!"", 'Considering the high quality of the PGA Tour games from EA Sports, the latest version, PGA Tour Pro, is a disappointment. While it\'s full of interesting and unique features, not all are executed particularly well. <P> PGA Tour Pro enters a genre thick with competition, yet still claims bragging rights on a couple of key points. First, tournament play is still the best on the PC, due to the PGA Tour relationship. You actually golf against pros Davis Love III, Tom Kite, Fuzzy Zoeller, Craig Stadler, Mark O\'Meara, Jeff Sluman, Jim Gallagher, Brad Faxon, Peter Jacobsen, and Chip Beck, complete with swing and reaction animations. In tournament mode, this makes play really come alive. <P> The second strong element of PGA Tour Pro is the smooth implementation of Internet play via EA Sports Net. The player-matching service is actually integrated into the game, needing nothing more than an active TCP/IP connection. Inside EA Sports Net, competitors can set up games for up to four people online at once, and worldwide competition for prizes is in the offing. Online text and audio chat is supported. This beats the Jack Nicklaus Online Tour, the Virtual Open (for British Open), and Links LS to the punch. <P> The game itself has some problems. Since its last incarnation in 1996, it has been substantially redesigned. It is now Windows 95 native, and the expected step forward in graphics and redraw times is indeed present. But while the graphics are visually quite lush, they are also curiously flat: terrain and trees don\'t pop out the way they do in Links LS or even Jack Nicklaus 4. Inscreen animation has been added, but it is also quite screwy. The waving flags are fine, but the ocean looks like something from a grade-school play: part of it is animated in choppy waves, and the other part is motionless, with neither color palette matching. Sounds are the weakest part of the production, with adequate ambient sound, but poor ball noises. <P> As with the previous version, the variety and quality of camera angles is tops. Ball cam, blimp view, reverse angles, and all kinds of cameras are available on the course. Only two can be open at once, but you can rotate and move the view to achieve practically any angle you need. Greens are hard to read, but a new method has been added to aid shot making. Instead of just the standard grid option, you can also choose putting lines: a row of arched lines radiated out from your golfer to help read greens. Figuring out the best way to use them may take some time, but this new approach shows promise as an alternative to the grid, which has never worked that well. <P> Swing control has gone down a notch with a redesign of the swing bar. It\'s still a three-stage power bar, but instead of wrapping around the player, it\'s represented by an almost old-fashioned circle in the lower right-hand corner. A new ""risk meter"" has been incorporated into a portion of the power bar. When you design your shot, the risk meter gauges its chances of success on a bar from green (an easy shot) to red (a hard shot), perhaps included for people who absolutely must know their chances of success. <P> Shot making and club selection is unsatisfactory. When you aim your shot, the computer almost invariably picks too much club as your default. You must pick a shot type, pick a club, and aim the shot - in that order. If you aim and then pick a club, the aiming arrow changes. If you pick a shot, say a chip, you automatically get a default club. In the case of a chip, this is always the seven iron. It is a terrible way of handling shot design and makes for maximum confusion. (British Open still has the best shot design features.) Ball physics, especially in sand and rough shots, are modeled well - though wind effects could be better. <P> Three course come with PGA Tour Pro: Pebble Beach, TPC Scottsdale, and Bay Hill. Each is recreated quite accurately and offers a perfect variety of challenges and terrains. Previous PGA Tour courses can be used in the new version, and more are expected. <P> PGA Tour Pro offers just about everything you could want in a game, but it doesn\'t always do it very well. It has some strong elements and will probably become the choice for Internet gaming because of its matchmaking service. But while it was once a series that lead the category, it\'s now just one of the pack. <i>--T. Liam McDonald</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

664,Lords of Magic: Special Edition (Jewel Case),"['<i>The Lords of Magic Special Edition</i> combines the turn-based exploration and real-time combat of the enhanced <i>Lords of Magic</i> with the all-new <i>Legends of Urak Quest Pack.</i>', ""When we first looked at Impressions' Lords of Magic, we were less than impressed. The game had tons of potential but was marred by numerous flaws, both in the overall design and several specific gameplay elements (you can see our original review here). Lords of Magic Special Edition promises to address the original game's shortcomings - and lo and behold it actually does. The only problem is that the game is still flawed in many ways and is not all that much more compelling than the original."", ""Without rehashing all of the basic information on story and game flow, we'll stick to addressing the changes in the Special Edition and how they affect the overall gameplay experience. One of the more notable new features is the included Legends of Urak Quest Pack. This expansion set of five scripted campaigns challenges you to complete a series of specific quests, sort of like the scenarios in Civilization II. For example, in one quest you play a Death Mage and must find and recover a sacred scepter for your lord, the King of Darkness. Another quest is based on Arthurian legends."", ""Another new feature is the lord editor, which basically allows you to modify your character at the beginning of each game. Instead of accepting the game's default settings for starting heroes, you can modify your starting army choosing units from any of the eight faiths. Using the new map editor, you can also customize the world in which you play."", 'The Special Edition features a number of new creatures, including one legendary creature for each faith. There are also many new wandering creatures as well as a general increase in ""marauding parties"" - easily the game\'s most annoying and infuriating feature. Marauding parties seem to be the rough equivalent to Civilization\'s barbarian tribes, except that they appear at alarming rates and mete out rather severe beatings in the face of seemingly superior opposition. Many a time I found myself cursing the puny marauding parties of wolves and centaurs who would take out half of my precious units and set me back by several days (that\'s game time, not real time).', ""One point in the Special Edition's favor is the fact that, although you spend far too much time battling marauding parties, you will probably spend far less time quarreling with your neighbors - even Balkoth. This is due to the game's enhanced diplomacy model, which offers more options and seems to have fewer loopholes. No longer will Balkoth fork over a level 5 hero when you plead for him (offering nothing in return). You can still acquire another faith's hero, but you have to put up some serious barter to do so. Also, whenever you put an offering on the bargaining table, the game will tell you whether or not it's a fair deal before you accept or decline it. This can be useful for avoiding ill feelings over unintentionally one-sided trade demands."", ""As a result of the improved diplomacy model (and presumably of improved AI), the game plays out a bit more like the story would dictate. Individual faiths are not necessarily at each other's throats and, if you play your cards right, you can actually win the game more easily by befriending your neighbors (except that Balkoth character; nobody likes him). I should point out, though, that the Fire faith begins the game in a very deep hole. No other faith has a positive opinion of Fire (except Chaos, which is typically the weakest of the AI-controlled faiths), and most are downright hostile right from the start."", ""In terms of problems that have been fixed, load times in the Special Edition are generally speedier (a very good thing), and Impressions has added an option to auto-compute battle results before loading the real-time combat engine. There's a trade-off to this, however, as now the auto-compute results are a bit less favorable to your side than they were in the original game."", 'You can now interact with any of your buildings without actually marching a hero to it - a very big improvement. This both saves time and allows you to manage your campaign without running back and forth to the capital city all of the time.', 'Though the Special Edition features several improvements, there remain a number of unresolved issues. For starters, it still takes far too long for your troops to recover from battle wounds, especially when they are low-level units. This means that for every minor skirmish you fight, you often have to rest for three or four days just to get your grunts back into fighting trim. While you rest, your AI opponents are building bigger fortunes and bigger, more-powerful armies.', 'Of course, the computer faiths may just have an advantage because they all seem to begin the game with armies that are at least twice as powerful as yours. They also seem to begin with more gold, more crystals, and more ale - all for no apparent reason.', 'Catching up to the AI requires that you take over your fair share of mines and breweries, but that is a nearly impossible task in the early going. In general, there seem to be fewer first- and second-level caves near your starting city, regardless of your faith. This means that you have to attack higher-level monsters earlier than you should. As a result, it is very difficult to keep your troops alive, let alone develop them into seasoned veterans.', 'And even unit advancement seems to have been slowed considerably. Troops often go through numerous battles - against higher-level foes - without gaining enough experience to move up a level. The final result of all these minor issues is that the game is far more difficult now, even on the easiest difficulty setting.', ""Real-time combat certainly doesn't help matters much. In fact, apart from adding multilevel dungeons and buildings for the combat mode, this aspect of the game doesn't seem to have changed much. It is still difficult to see all of your units clearly when they fight the enemy at close quarters. More to the point, it's extremely difficult to target the enemy units in these situations. This wouldn't be a huge problem except for the fact that your units often stand there doing nothing after they kill off their initial targets - whether or not there happen to be enemy units nearby. Troops still get hung up on the scenery, so real-time battles are still the same old micromanagement madness that they have always been."", 'Then there\'s the minor issue of defeating one of the other lords in battle. You might think that by defeating another faith\'s leader - and thereby eliminating them from the game (at least as far as Balkoth\'s goals of conquest are concerned) - you would have made your life a bit easier. But no. As soon as you fell your colleague, vast armies of his faith will pour into your lands, hurling themselves against your forces until they eventually overwhelm and destroy you. I wouldn\'t find this ""feature"" so odious if not for the fact that the same courtesy is unavailable to you (when your character dies, the game is over).', 'The Special Edition corrects a number of flaws and adds several new features but somehow ends up being only a tiny bit more appealing than its predecessor. For those players who enjoyed the original game, the many enhancements in the Special Edition probably make it a must-have. But for the rest of us, Heroes of Might &amp; Magic II (and soon III) and Warlords III are simply better options for a fantasy-strategy fix. <i>--Michael E.

Within this double-sized box are included: the original <i>Quake 2</I>, <i>Mission Pack 1: The Reckoning</i>, <i>Mission Pack 2: Ground Zero</i>, and the <i>Quake 2 Netpack 1: Extremities</i>. As a collector\'s item, <i>Quad Damage</i> will have fans of <i>Quake 2</I> falling over each other with excitement. For anyone who\'s just interested in finding out what the hoopla is about, <i>Quad Damage</i> has everything to get you fully entrenched in the world of this epic game.<P> Unless you\'ve been living in a separatist compound in Idaho you\'ve heard of <i>Quake 2</i>. As a lone Space Marine, you\'re called upon to save the Earth from the vicious Stroggs, a nasty bunch of biomechanical aliens from the planet Stroggos who want nothing more than to destroy this wonderful world of ours. With a plethora of single-player levels, you\'ll while away many a frightful hour as you gib and frag your way to victory. While <i>Quake 2</i>\'s single-player story line has been impugned for being less than interesting, there\'s no debating the fact that the game\'s multiplayer capabilities are topnotch. With eight ""official"" multiplayer levels and a gang of user-created maps available on the Internet you\'ll no doubt put your marriage in jeopardy.<P> <i>The Reckoning</i> is the first Mission Pack to be released for <i>Quake 2</i> and picks up where the original game left off. While gamers looking for something new will be disappointed with the <i>Reckoning</i>, anyone who loved <i>Quake 2</i> will undoubtedly be into it. <i>The Reckoning</i> boasts 18 new single-player levels and seven new deathmatch levels. Among the <i>Reckoning</i>\'s new enemies, the Repair Bots are easily the most annoying as they have the ability to resurrect dead bad guys who that haven\'t been gibbed.

667,SimCity 2000 Special Edition - PC,"[""This is the most popular sim of all time, cranked up to a high-tech gloss and packaged with all the popular expansion sets. The original SimCity gave players the opportunity to create and oversee the growth of a living city as well as all its problems: crime, pollution, zoning demands, power outages, traffic foul-ups, and the occasional tornado, nuclear meltdown, or wandering monster from the sea. Less a game in the usual sense of the word than a sort of electronic ant farm, SimCity let players see how they fared as mayor, architect and town council. Now SimCity 2000 adds adjustable topography to the fun, using a terrain editor which can create mountains, valleys, ravines, etc. (The new types of terrain also permit the construction of hydroelectric dams and water towers.) Necessitated by this new addition is a new viewing engine, which rotates the player's municipality in 90 degree increments, so that new mountaintop university doesn't block your view of the burgeoning slum down below. As the town progresses through the decades, the sheer size and technological sophistication of your creations become more and more outlandish, and the resultant metropolis ends up looking like something out of Blade Runner. It can take quite a while to become familiar with Maxis' Sim series, and even longer to actually succeed at long-term city goals. Once you get beyond the learning curve, however, the cycle of planning, construction and urban renewal leads to a rewarding creation. And, as always, hard-won cities from earlier versions of the game can be imported for alteration and experimentation. <i>--Chris Hudak/SpotMedia Communications</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

670,Zork Grand Inquisitor,"[""You are a lone adventurer drawn into the Grand Inquisitor's attempt to attack magic, the very fabric of the Great Underground Empire. With a Flathead, a Brogmoid, a Griffin, and the Dungeon Master as your allies, you must retrieve the three enchanted treasures. Spells, maps, and special tools will help you in your quest to return magic to the empire. This fantasy adventure is enhanced with DVD audio-and-video technology. The graphic detail of the Underground environment introduces new characters, landmarks, and intriguing puzzles."", 'In the first of many clever references to its predecessors in the Zork series, Grand Inquisitor opens with a bald foppish dictator banning the use of magic throughout the Great Underground Empire. For gamers who plodded through the rather tedious Return to Zork and oddly humorless Zork Nemesis, the plot device is an obvious metaphor for what has happened to the longest-running series (20 years!) in computer gaming. Zork\'s signature wit and absurdity seemed to have been lost in the jump from text to graphic adventuring. Well, the magic may be gone from the land, but it has not vanished from the game. Grand Inquisitor is the best graphical Zork yet, and one of the most consistently entertaining adventures of the year. <P> Of course, your job is to usurp the technocratic Grand Inquisitor and his repressive anti-magic policies. After a brief visit to Port Foozle, you locate the GUE (Great Underground Empire) and spend much of the game hunting down the three lost artifacts (the Coconut of Quendor, the Skull of Yoruk, and the Cube of Foundation) that will restore magic to Zork. All that remains of last year\'s Nemesis title is the basic gaming interface. Full motion video sequences punctuate your movement among static, prettily drawn settings. The ""Z-Vision"" device is here again, letting you spin 360 degrees in place at various locations for a more involving view of the terrain. Very handy menus of usable objects and magic spells appear at the top of the screen, and a good inventory screen lets you examine and combine the many found objects and learned spells along the way.  <P> While the basic item-gathering and puzzle-solving of Grand Inquisitor is far from innovative, the triumph of the game is its seamless, witty execution. Enemies of the Inquisitor are ""totemized,"" squished and consigned to spend eternity in steel reinforced hockey pucks. One such resistor, a wiseass Dungeon Master, is sealed within a lantern and accompanies you through much of the journey. He blurts asides to most of your unsuccessful actions: ""Ooh! That\'s gotta hurt."" And these snide characterizations form the real charm of the game. A two-headed Cerebus blocks you at Hell\'s door, mocking your standard attempts to get by. ""Go ahead, dig into the old inventory. Something\'s gotta work!"" A pair of talking torches, one grumpy and the other neurotic, refuses to be picked up or to work properly in certain situations. Thankfully, and unlike most ""humorous"" computer adventures, the scripting is genuinely funny and well acted. The old television actors\' homes got emptied out for this one, but to very good effect. Dirk Benedict (A-Team, Battlestar Galactica) plays a TV action hero whose brio gets him into scrapes with the Inquisitor, which we follow in cutscenes throughout. Michael McKean of SNL, Spinal Tap, and Laverne and Shirley (Lenny) plays the DM with just the right amount of irony. Squiggy (David Lander) does a short cameo as the voice of a torch as well. Real old-timers like Marty Ingels and Rip Taylor take their comic turns as well in a nicely cast, well-written game that keeps the puzzle-solving light and fun. <P> The puzzles themselves are familiar Zorkisms. How do you retrieve the Coconut of Quendor from the soft palate of that sleeping dragon with some combination of inflatable toys, a gold tooth, and a bicycle pump? What exactly is the use of a magic spell that makes the color purple invisible? Of course, you will need to figure out how to make the Totemizer machine work in your favor and decipher a cryptic map of prison cells in order to free poor Dirk Benedict - the usual reverse engineering tasks of the computer adventurer. They are not tiresome or gratuitous, however. Grand Inquisitor succeeds in keeping the obstacles solvable and sensible (in a Zorky kind of way) within the fictional world.  <P> The weaknesses are few and forgivable. The game world feels too small and short-lived. Much of the hunting and gathering involves fewer than a dozen major areas, like the GUE University, the Dungeon Master\'s house, and the Monastery. Brief hops into Hades and Port Foozle are fun too, but I wished for greater vistas to explore. It all ends in about 15 hours of playtime. And the only irritating part of the gameplay comes from the Z-Vision spinning panorama. The cursor changes to a directional pointer when you face a new open area to explore, but some of these places are so close together that you can overlook an essential little niche too easily. You should scan the entire screen carefully and look for changes in the cursor that indicate smaller nooks or different viewing angles on the same scene. Finally, there is a beta version of a linked, two-player mode, via Net or modem. The second player is purported to take a kibitzing role, merely pointing to areas or items that the main adventurer might try. While I got the Java-based add-on to connect easily enough to the Net, there wasn\'t a playmate to be found there, and probably for good reason. Just on the face of it, this feels like a silly stab at the mutliplayer craze.  <P> Compact and unspectacular as it is, Zork: Grand Inquisitor is a model of adventure gaming as good entertainment. Many of the genre\'s conventions (FMV, item hunting, absurdist humor) get polished to a high sheen here. It is funny and reflexive without being geeky or pointlessly ironic. The third-string actors exploit their comic trademarks to good effect. Real attention is paid to the pacing of the whole affair, so there are no overly quiet dead zones of tedious activity. And the puzzles are fun to solve rather than gratuitous brain-teasing exercises.  <P> All in all, you are made to feel a part of a playful jaunt through a silly world. Truly, the lads and lasses at Activision have succeeded in restoring the magic to Zork, and in doing so have provided us with a good baseline for measuring competent design in the genre. <I>--Steve Smith</I> <BR><I>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Cars include the &lt;b&gt;Aston Martin DB7&lt;/b&gt;, Ferrari 550 Maranello, and the Lamborghini Diablo SV, and more!', 'I don\'t usually play racing games on the PC. Either they\'re pale imitations of the arcade and console racers, or they\'re boring 50-lap simulations. I mean, why play Need for Speed II and Test Drive 4 on the PC when I can play Super GT in the arcade and Gran Turismo on the PlayStation? For ages, I told friends that the PC had nothing on the arcade, even venerable classics like Daytona and Sega Rally. Well, I think I\'m going to be eating crow for the next few weeks... and loving it. Not only is the latest Need for Speed miles ahead of the last NFS game, but it approaches (and dare I say surpasses?), the best of the consoles in terms of sheer fun and speed. <P> Need for Speed III is a great game. It has an exhilarating sense of speed, clean and beautiful graphics, polished production values, and trackloads of unadulterated fun. In many ways, Need for Speed III has that same addictive quality I found in Quake II, Starcraft, and Heroes of Might and Magic. That\'s pretty celebrated company, but I don\'t think it\'s an unfounded categorization. Need for Speed III has that same ""just one more turn or just one more deathmatch"" quality that the other games have.

This game is fast and fun. The frame rate is fast and incredibly clean. I\'ve played my fair share of PC and console racers where the pop-up was horrible, as cliffs and buildings would suddenly appear out of thin air, many seconds after you should have seen them on the horizon. Whether it\'s the smart track design or the beautiful engine, the bottom line is that I only saw one or two instances of minor pop-up. And multiplayer is as fast and fun as the single-player experience. The sound of your revving engine and the fast frame rate both combined to create the illusion of breakneck speeds, although the replays didn\'t look quite as fast I would have liked. <P> Aside from the speed and addictive quality, Need for Speed III has the requisite list of features that marketers like to put on boxes, journalists like to list, and consumers always look for. There are many cars, with subtle differences, and the ability to tweak more than a few car qualities, such as steering speed, aerodynamics, and suspension. And, surprisingly, the tweaks will affect your car noticeably. <P> In classic Need for Speed fashion, there are more than a dozen supercars to race, including several bonus cars that open up with sustained excellent race results or cheat codes. The range of cars is a fascinating gallery of every car enthusiast\'s dream vehicles: Corvettes, Ferraris, Lamborghinis, Porsches, Jaguars, Mercedes, and an Italdesign prototype car. There are also roughly ten tracks, including the bonus track, encompassing several different environments and difficulty levels. You\'ll race through a canyon, snowy mountain caps, urban utopia, and forests. You can race during nighttime and in rain to add further to the track variety. Visibility takes a huge hit in either condition, making races on the harder courses incredibly treacherous. Unfortunately, I didn\'t experience any noticeable difference in driving under rain; the road didn\'t appear any slicker and handling was pretty much consistent with perfect weapon. If there was a difference, it was too subtle for me to notice. <P> The single-player game modes include a single race, knockoff (where you eliminate the last place of each race), tournament (where you race through the entire circuit for points), and hot pursuit. Hot pursuit is EA\'s answer to all the critics who lamented the loss of the cops in Need for Speed II. You aren\'t only trying to outrace an opponent, but also escape the pursuing cops. Three tickets, and you\'re out. Or alternatively, you can play the cop in pursuit. The radio chatter alerting you to the cops\' presence and their strategies (pursuit or roadblock) are nice touches. <P> The graphics in the game are pretty amazing. The reflection on the cars is outstanding, as is the rain, and the leaves and dust that follow in your wake. The lighting is especially impressive during the night and rain races. Best of all, everything, including the up to seven competitors, animating background objects, and your rearview mirror, can be packed on screen with barely a hint of a performance hit (OK, sometimes, it will slow down slightly, but not by much). The production values on the track briefings and the car gallery are also first-rate. <P> There are a few problems. For one, the dashboard doesn\'t light up at night, and there are no windshield wipers at your disposal during rain. It\'s disappointing that there\'s no damage to your cars. I understand that none of the car companies want to see their poor little vehicles hurt in this game, but what\'s the excuse for not being able to dent the nonsupercars you crash into? And unlike in the latest Sega arcade racers, the cars in Need for Speed III, while maintaining an effective illusion of high-speed driving, sometimes appear too much like they are gliding on the road rather than actually driving and hugging the road. And why not just open all the regular cars (not the bonus cars) in hot pursuit, knockoff, and tournament mode? Still, it\'s a testament to the game\'s addictive fun factor that when I was racing, none of these shortcomings ever bothered me. While the arcades still have the edge in racing games, Need for Speed III goes a long way toward giving PC gamers a real taste of exhilarating arcade speed and action. <i>--Elliott Chin</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Who  knew?', '<I>Worms Armageddon</I> brings the humorously addictive gameplay of the very  popular <i>Worms</i> series to the Dreamcast for the first time. The strategy-based  gameplay is as unique as the premise. Commanding a team of worms, players wriggle  and shoot through 30 missions and 14 training levels. Players take turns moving a worm  warrior into position and then firing at the opposing team, using an arsenal of weapons  ranging from mines and kamikaze attacks to the more traditional exploding sheep attack  and banana bombs. Naturally, the commander who best combines strategic moves with  creative attacks wins the worm war.', ""Join the throngs of fans of this unique game series and you'll never look at a grinning,  gun-toting earthworm in the same way again. <i>--Eric Twelker</i>"", 'Do you ever wonder what worms do in their free time? The third chapter of the popular Worms series, Worms Armageddon, has you believe that instead of just hiding under rocks and floating down storm drains, worms are actually ruthlessly militant creatures with boyish British accents. This simple, somewhat innocent premise sets the stage for an excellent turn-based strategy game, as Worms Armageddon is not only the best Worms game, it\'s also an incredible multiplayer experience. The concept is pretty simple: You control a team of well-armed worms, and your objective is to kill the other worms any way you can. You do this on a 2D plane that\'s usually a series of odd platforms and objects precariously placed over deadly water. The combat itself takes place in a series of timed turn-based rounds that seamlessly flow into each other. Each of your worms shares a collective arsenal from which you can choose all sorts of weapons - from the devastatingly serious to the laughably wacky. From there, you switch to a manual aiming and firing scheme used to unleash your weapon of choice at the worm you\'re targeting. This leads to all sorts of havoc, as combat tends to lend itself to poorly aimed explosives and the fun effects they cause. The worms and everything around them have a distinctly animated look to them. Big eyes and oddly shaped household items show the comic-strip influence of the graphics, and combined with the simple 2D layout, it makes Worms Armageddon something of a throwback to simpler times. The detail is simple but effective, and it helps support the humorous themes running through the game\'s elements. Switching to more offbeat weapons will generally change your character\'s appearance - a worm will don a headband before administering a dragon-punch, and a worm armed with a battle-ax is also outfitted with a Viking helmet. Explosions and animations are simple - worms shuffle along when you\'re moving them, and explosives blow up within a pretty obvious radius. Still, more detail to some animations, such as the shotgun fire, could have provided Worms with a bit more graphical prowess and, in turn, could have helped sort out exactly where the blast hit (or missed). Apparently, all worms come from Europe somewhere and have a definite lack of testosterone in their voices. Squeaky, high-pitched speech fills the game with colorful comments from your worm army as you play. If a live grenade is tossed next to you, your worm will scream, ""Run for it."" If it completely misses, your worm will ask, ""What was that?"" This effect is only mildly cute and strictly tiptoes the fine line of being annoying. Other sound effects - such as explosions, bouncing grenades, and submachine gun fire - are done well and lend a bit of realism to an otherwise unrealistic experience. Mild, almost unnoticeable music plays in the background and helps you focus on the task at hand. The only particularly bad thing about the audio is the German beer commercial-like Euro-dance that pulses over the title screen. Still, a few button presses, and this is all but forgotten. It\'s the weapons in this game that make it really fun. Every combat game may have grenades and shotguns, but not a whole lot of them have pneumatic drills, ninja ropes, supersheep, and sticks of dynamite. This huge assortment of instruments used to deal out the pain keeps things fairly fresh and funny, as each weapon has its own silly effect. Still, there are some weapons that are just too powerful, and once you\'ve mastered them, they have a countereffect on the gameplay. On top of that, instead of switching off between worms, the turn system switches off between teams - meaning a team with a single worm will get four turns before four worm on one team goes once. This makes it unduly difficult to kill the last worm on a team, as he easily gets a tactical advantage with his multiple turns. It\'s terribly frustrating to be killed before you can even get a shot off. Multiplayer is where this game is at. With the Dreamcast&#x92;s multiple controller ports, you can easily go at it with up to three friends. And because most players can think pretty quickly, the multiplayer gameplay quickly turns into a barrage of havoc, with grenades and bazooka rounds flying all over the place. The easy-to-pick-up gameplay makes this a great party game, and the ensuing hilarity from the calamity that is bound to happen makes this a game everyone can laugh at. Unfortunately, the single-player game just isn\'t as good. The computer has eagle-eye accuracy, and down to its last worm it is capable of factoring in wind, trajectory, and ricochet, so it can place that one deadly bazooka shell halfway across a level, through a series of ledges, and right on top of your worm. This makes it all the more frustrating to play against the computer, as it seems to almost cheat. Still, the AI is capable of doing some pretty lame things itself, such as bouncing a grenade back to its sender or shooting the floor out from under itself. But the AI definitely favors certain weapons - the bazooka, grenades, shotgun, and mines are all high on the AI\'s list of weapons of choice, while the dragon punch, the battle-ax, or the Uzi are almost never wielded by the computer-controlled worms. Unfortunately, even with the Dreamcast\'s ""it\'s thinking"" hardware, the computer still tends to take an extremely long time plotting exactly how it\'s going to attack your troops, and, as such, you spend a lot of the single-player game just waiting for a worm to make its move.  Worms Armageddon is designed so you can play with other people, and the single-player match is really no substitute. If you\'ve got plenty of friends who spend their time lounging around your place, definitely pick this one up for some rewarding gameplay and good laughs. Although the game has its weak points, the solid gameplay and simple control make this game a must-have for anyone who likes to play games with other humans.<i>--Ben Stahl</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

712,Centipede,"['Disc(s) only. Ships in generic case. Disc(s) are professoinally cleaned. Guaranteed functional or replacement.', ""It's getting more and more difficult these days to think of a classic game that hasn't been revamped and rereleased on a current-day console, and Centipede is no exception. It first made its way to the PlayStation in May, and now the new 'pede-shooting adventure can be found on the Dreamcast. But while it's slightly better than its PlayStation brother, Centipede is still only average, at best.  This time around, the game has a plotline. You're Wally, a simple bean counter who's somehow chosen to pilot the Wee People's last hope, The Shooter, against the QueenPede and her countless brood. You'll fly about in five different worlds, shooting bugs, creating mushrooms, defending villages, and rescuing your fellow Wee People from the clutches of the vile centipedes. You've got better tricks at your disposal than you had in the original game, as you'll be able to upgrade your main cannon, fire secondary weapons, and use shields. However, the game is pretty much the same. You turn countless centipedes into mushrooms, blast spiders, and avoid touching anything dangerous. Now that you're in a somewhat 3D environment you get a better control scheme. You can now use the shoulder buttons to strafe, making it easy to fly circles around your enemies. And instead of being limited to the bottom third of the screen, you can now roam wherever you like - up hills, across chasms, and through the villages of the Wee People. And now you can jump, which makes it easy to hop over troublesome mushrooms and climb ledges for special power-ups. While much nicer than those in the PlayStation version, the graphics in this game don't really challenge the hardware of the Dreamcast. Everything looks fairly nice, but more advanced features, such as detailed lighting and shading effects, are absent. The game supports three views, which drastically change the appearance of the game. From the top-down view, you can see most of the level, and everything looks rather plain. When you switch to the first-person mode you'll notice nice details, like the eyes of the spiders and the menacing teeth of the centipedes. You'll also see that houses have doors, windows, and other nice details, and the Wees start to look like people. Once in the first-person view, you'll start to get a feel for the tiny world in which the Wee People live - from the lighthouses perched on pebbles to the windmills hidden beneath tall blades of grass. Unfortunately, once you've seen one Wee village, you've seen 'em all. Sound effects are present in the game, but they give you the sensation that there's still something missing. A generic techno beat fills the background music, and remade versions of the classic sound effects tell you when you hit something, but at times it seems as though the appropriate sound effect is missing. Also, while the soundtrack and sound effects are clear, the audio that runs during the cutscenes has a lot of hiss to it, and, and it sounds rather low-quality.  If you've got a friend who's up for saving a few Wee People, you can play cooperatively. This mode is actually pretty cool, though with the exception of the split screen, there's no difference between this mode and the one-player mode. The frame rate stays at a smooth level, and the pop-up remains just as unnoticed.  Like most classic games being remade, Centipede also features a fairly accurate port of the original game. But unlike in the PlayStation version, the original game actually does well on the Dreamcast, with a perfect frame rate and accurate graphics and sound. Fans of the original will be pleased will the excellent translation. Unfortunately, as with virtually all the classic games reborn on a current-day console, playing the new version of Centipede is really nothing like playing the original. What's really disappointing is that instead of shooting centipedes over and over, you could have instead been exploring a great 3D world and blasting away tons of cool enemies. But instead, Centipede tries too hard to latch on to the classic gaming experience, and it pulls what could have been a great 3D shooter into the hollows of the average. <i>--Ben Stahl</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

And besides, they weren't really interested in eating you anyway - they were just after your crystals. <P>Rock Raiders is one of two games being released for the console by Lego Media (the other is Lego Racers), and it's a 3D action game with some resource management involved. In the seven-minute intro, you're introduced to a spaceship full of Lego men who don't talk so much as make recognizable grunts, moans, and squeals so that people from all parts of the world can understand them. In any case, their ship gets sucked into a black hole and spat out in another galaxy, and they must land on a planet and drill for ore and crystals so that they'll have enough energy to get back home. <P>You begin by teleporting a bunch of Lego guys down to the mines on the unknown planet and ordering them to drill. The goal is to gather enough crystals and ore to get you home. As mentioned, no one dies in the Lego world, and there are some monsters. When a Lego guy gets too weak, he's teleported back to the ship for recuperation. The PC version of this game is very much about resource management, but the PlayStation version, in addition to having some resource management elements also has a more arcade-y feel and more adventurous missions. Monsters include the rock monsters, ice monsters (who pick up Lego guys and squeeze them), slugs who slime up the walkways, and so on. Mostly, the monsters want your crystals because that's their food, and they'll wreck your nice compound to get it.  But they won't eat you. <P>You'll have a number of vehicles to play with, including a helicopter and a ground vehicle with a big drill. You'll confront lava, water, monsters, and thick walls, but there won't be any unexpected mine collapses to kill you - although some of the missions may include rescuing comrades trapped in a mineshaft somewhere. Weapons you'll have include the push gun (which pushes monsters away), the freeze gun, the laser, the teleporter gun, and dynamite. We're not sure right now if you can use your big drill to drill into monsters, but it sure is a good idea. <P>Rock Raiders is supposed to launch at the same time the new Lego set does - October of this year.

While you may not remain interested in the single-player mission to see it to its completion, the four-player multiplayer in Quake II will make you glad you had picked up a multitap and three extra Dual Shocks. <P>The storyline is your typical hostile alien sort of thing. You, as a space marine, land on the planet of Stroggos with the intention of blowing up everything in sight. Unfortunately, you get separated from the rest of the marines and are forced to go it alone. So now you must run all over this planet, collecting keys, opening doors, taking elevators, and wiping out various alien monsters before they tear you in half. To wipe out these aliens, you'll have to find weapons - your wimpy default blaster simply won't cut it. You'll find a couple shotguns, two types of machine guns, a grenade launcher, a rocket launcher, and two types of energy weapons - one of which is the almighty BFG, a gun that spits out a huge power ball and wipes out just about anything that gets near the blast. You'll also find a great deal of ammo, armor, and health scattered about the levels. <P>A game like this really requires a good control scheme to succeed. Thanks to excellent use of the Dual Shock controller, it has one. In the default setup, you use the left stick to look around and the four buttons on the front of the pad to move in any of four directions. You can also configure the right analog stick so you can use it in much the same way. The R buttons handle firing and jumping, and the L buttons let you cycle through your weaponry. You can play the game on a standard controller, but trust me - you wouldn't want to. The game also supports the PlayStation mouse, but if you're  already used to using a mouse to control your first-person shooters, then you probably have a PC and you've been playing the PC version of Quake II for ages, making this game mostly useless. <P>Graphically, the PlayStation really does a decent job. The textures may look a little washed-out, a few models may have been simplified, and a few frames of animation may have been chopped here and there, but overall, the game runs at a very playable speed. The tradeoff is that the game has much more frequent loads. Most of the level modification between the PC and PlayStation versions is in the addition of many more small, closed-off hallways that serve as little loading areas. At first it's not a big deal, but when you've got to go back and forth between different parts of a level to accomplish various tasks, loading every 20-30 seconds is enough to make you crazy. The game's sound effects and music are taken directly from the PC version, and overall, the sound is great. <P>The multiplayer mode is where this title picks up most of its value points. Sure, a few of the multiplayer levels are a little on the weak side, but there are enough good ones that it doesn't really matter. The three modes in the game are standard deathmatch, team deathmatch, and versus. Versus mode is a last-man-standing affair, where you and up to three friends duke it out until only one of you remains. The coolest multiplayer option is the gravity slider, which lets you turn gravity way down for some really high-flying action, or turn it way up to keep people from hopping around like lunatics. Sure, it's not as versatile as being able to program your own modifications to the game, but it's a nice touch, and it manages to breathe a bit of life into the game. <P>In the end, the PlayStation version of Quake II falls under the same disclaimers as most other PC-to-console first-person shooters - if you own the PC version, don't waste your time. But if you're looking for some good split-screen shooting action with a decent single-player mode to back it up, this version will make your day. --Jeff Gerstmann <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

723,Wipeout 3,"[""The futuristic racing series Wipeout has lost some of its steam with this third entry--but <I>Wipeout 3</I> is still worth a look and a listen. This fast-action franchise has frequently been characterized as being more about style than substance. While we don't necessarily agree with that analysis, it is true that <I>Wipeout 3</I> can overwhelm the senses with an amazing amount of eye and ear candy. The graphics are simply stunning, while the techno-charged soundtrack boasts some of the top names in electronica, including Chemical Brothers, Underworld, and Orbital."", 'Pulsating rhythms aside, <I>Wipeout 3</I> offers players a wild ride through eight distinct tracks. It will take more than perpetual motion to make it to the end of each race. In order to complete each timed race, gamers are required to hit strategically placed power ups while navigating many near-impossible turns. The heart-racing action offers a tough challenge for dedicated games, but <I>Wipeout 3</I> ultimately does not offer any significant improvement over earlier titles in the acclaimed series. <I>--Brett Atwood</i>', '<b>Pros:</b> <ul> <li>Fast-action gameplay</li> <li>Contemporary soundtrack</li> </ul> <b>Cons:</b> <ul><li>No significant improvement over previous Wipeout titles</li> </ul>', ""At one time, there were those within Psygnosis who were unsure that Wipeout would return to the PlayStation, because it wasn't clear whether anything more could be done within the confines of the aging platform. But the advent of the analog controller, SCE's PlayStation code optimization utilities, and a few new imaginative ideas on the part of Psygnosis have all combined to make the series a trilogy. (Yes, let's just decide right here and now to forget Wipeout 64 entirely.) <P>Futuristic racing is the rule of the day in all the Wipeout games. You compete in a series of winding courses that can only be raced by the sleekest of antigravity hovercraft. You gain boosts in velocity by flying over speed pads and acquire offensive capabilities by going over the weapon pads. Each vehicle is equipped with shields, which are worn down by enemy fire and by bumping into track walls, and are recharged by entering each course's pit lane. W3 introduces a new element that drains the shield energy: the hyper-thrust. By hitting the R1 button, your craft can achieve incredible speeds, but it is then much more open to crashing or being blown up by opponents. The tightrope walk of balancing thrust and shields is the first main difference between Wipeout 3 and its predecessors.  <P>The first tournament (not the only mode in the game, but its meat and potatoes) is incredibly easy. You can beat it without using the hyper-thrust, a single offensive power-up, or the air brakes, which help you coax your machine around corners. But the tournament mode then goes from very easy to unbelievably hard, as the courses in the second tournament are so difficult that it's hard to place in any of them, let alone all in a row. The first two tracks - Sampa Run and Hi-Fumi - are very challenging, but you can master them after playing them for an hour to an hour and a half each, while the third track - P-Mar Project - is so snaky that it's evil that the developers didn't save it for later. There is no middle ground in W3. The learning curve in the first two games was gradual and fun to play, but this one is surprisingly severe. You'll have to hit the hyper-thrust on the straight-aways, aim into the pit or steal shield energy from opponents by using the energy-drain power-up (one of several new weapons), and use the air brake to shimmy around every corner just to place at all. It calls to mind hopping around while trying to balance a plate at the end of a stick from the tip of your nose, two index fingers, big toe, and knee. It can be that tough, but if you give it enough time - a lot of time - it actually becomes almost second nature. <P>Since you'll find the tournament nigh impossible to beat at first, you'll end up checking out the game's challenge mode, which is made up of tasks in race, weapon, and time categories. Race lets you hone your skills against other opponents, one track at a time. The super-difficult tournament courses can eventually be unlocked, and while they take more than an hour of practice to beat, they are fun to play singly, and they prepare you for the eventual return to the tournament. The weapon mode requires you to destroy a varying number of enemies within a varying number of passes on progressively tougher courses, and time trial sets a time by which you have to finish. These challenges are like the practice mode in House of the Dead 2; they're almost more enjoyable than the main game, and they help you master all the skills you'll need to win. <P>The other main addition to Wipeout on the PlayStation is the split-screen two-player mode. If you wanted to compete against a friend in Wipeout XL, you had to use the PlayStation link cable and set up two TVs with two PlayStations right next to each other. Not only do you not have to put that much work into it anymore, you now have two modes designed to work well with two players. The two-player tournament is a fantastic addition that gives the game a huge amount of replay value. The challenge presented by the single-player tournament is immense, and just imagine it with the addition of a real-live human opponent added to the mix. It's exactly the sort of thing players have been requesting for years, and with it, Psygnosis has set a new standard for console racing games. There's another mode, called elimination, which is similar to the weapon challenge - you compete for the highest number of ships destroyed - but since you fight race-by-race instead of in an elimination tournament, you probably won't return to it very often. It also exists in the single-player side, where it's even more aimless. <P>Graphics and music have always been especially important to Wipeout, and in W3, they're still quite impressive. The game's techno soundtrack comprises songs from Underworld, Chemical Brothers, and Propellerheads, and while the tracks aren't quite as strong as those in Wipeout XL (the WXL soundtrack was likely the best in any home game, so it's hard to beat), they're still very, very good. The graphics look a little grainy this time out, but pop-up is nonexistent in single-player and not too rough in the multiplayer. Essentially, W3 looks and sounds the way you'd expect it to: great.. It could be said that the series has lost some of its arcade racing-game appeal. It's always been a smart arcade racer, and now it's positively brainy, for better and worse. You'll have to memorize where you want to come out around every corner of every track, just like in Wipeout XL, but now you just have several other things to think about at the same time. W3 should appeal to longtime fans of the series who are looking for a new challenge and perhaps to folks who didn't find the license tests of Gran Turismo too frustrating. It is, however, sure to turn off many new players because of its high level of difficulty. Its pluses far outweigh its flaws, though, and while it doesn't steal the title belt from Wipeout XL as the best futuristic racing game of all time, it's a worthy sequel. --Joe Fielder <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

724,Space Invaders,"['Stop the Alien invasion in this Awesome Classic game. Good games never die! Play with a friend and go for the High Score. For Playstation One.', ""It is hard to resist the retro charms of video games of the past, which is why a lot of these titles are coming back to life on modern platforms. Activision's revamp of <i>Space Invaders</i> treads lightly on the hallowed ground of the original point-and-shoot alien game. Even the pregame film clip pays homage to the simple 1978 version. While based heavily on a game that is over 20 years old, this newer version contains enough newer gaming elements to re-energize the classic into a contemporary contender."", ""In particular, the addition of 3-D graphics brings new life to this well-traveled game, though it is odd to play without the now-infamous pixilated square enemies creeping toward the bottom of the screen. There are also a wider variety of enemy ships, guns, special powers, mother ships, and squadron formations to contend with. You can try your luck on your own, or get a second player to help you during combat, which is great for players with short attention spans. There are plenty of chances to gain extra lives, which helps those of us who lost more than a few quarters on this game at the arcade. <i>Space Invaders</i> is perfect if you don't want to play a game with a long, drawn-out plot. <i>--Carrie Bell</i>"", '<b>Pros:</b>', '']"

Not every package can contain 30 perfect classics. That\'s where this collection of Intellivision games comes in, bringing with it a swift reminder that even in the good old days, some games were just plain terrible. <P>The Intellivision is one of those console systems that most people have forgotten by now. Sure, there are people that are downright fanatical about the system and its games, but by and large its place in history is as ""The system that kids that weren\'t cool enough to have an Atari 2600 had."" <P>Contained in the package are Armor Battle, Astrosmash, Auto Racing, Baseball, Basketball, Boxing, Checkers, Chess, Football, Frog Bog, Golf, Hockey, Hover Force, Las Vegas Poker N Blackjack, Night Stalker, Pinball, Sea Battle, Shark! Shark!, Sharp Shot, Skiing, Snafu, Soccer, Space Armada, Space Battle, Space Hawk, Spiker! Super Pro Volleyball, Stadium Mud Buggies, Star Strike, Sub Hunt, and Tennis. It would have been nice to see the Dungeons & Dragons games, as well as the Tron games, but licensing issues probably put the kibosh on their inclusion. <P>Aside from the games, there\'s also a collection of short video clips that feature interviews with some of the original programmers. The only other option is the ability to save your game at any time. The Intellivision controller featured a keypad. So, to play this collection on the PlayStation, you must bring the keypad up on your screen, push whatever buttons you need to push, then close the keypad window. The keypad blocks a small portion of the screen, and it\'s generally a big hassle to use, especially in games like Las Vegas Poker N Blackjack, where most of the action takes place on the keypad. <P>A small screen that appears before each game starts quickly informs you of the controls, but it would have been nice also to see some onscreen directions or even scans of the original game manuals. Instead, you\'re forced to flip through the manual and read the usually terrible directions. While the poker and blackjack game has about five pages of directions, Hockey is limited to ""Objective: Score the most points as possible."" Granted, there\'s not a whole lot more you need to know about Hockey other than that objective and the controls, but even to put that in the manual seems totally silly. Also, given the simple nature of these games, there sure is quite a lot of loading involved in getting the games going. <P>If you were an Intellivision owner, and you believe that playing these games on a grossly inadequate controller will bring about pleasant feelings of nostalgia, then this is the package for you. But you must really have an attachment to these games - anyone else just won\'t get why you just spent the last four hours playing Astrosmash. --Jeff Gerstmann <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

Featuring all the teams and drivers of the 1999 season, including all newcomers and stand-in drivers, it also complies with all 1999 rules and regulations and has the voices of official TV commentators in English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, and Finnish."", ""<I>Formula 1 '99</I>'s third-generation simulation engine provides accurate driving sensations through realistic weather conditions without graphics slowdown or glitches. Also, its recorded F1 engine sounds deliver a true depiction of what a '99-spec Formula One car sounds like."", ""Formula One 99 is the latest reiteration of Psygnosis' long-running Formula One series, and it comes packed with an entirely new engine, features, tracks, and up-to-date rosters that make it the most advanced Formula One game yet.  As before, Formula One 99 is an officially licensed product of the 1999 Formula One World Championship series, and it carries with it all of the official teams, drivers, and tracks. The game, in fact, features quite impressive re-creations of all 16 of the 1999 Grand Prix circuit tracks, including the latest addition - the Sepang-F1- Circuit in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. To further the game's authenticity, Psygnosis has included settings for all of the rules and regulations, including stop-go penalties, full-flag system, and jump starts. The game has a ton of options that let you tweak and change the performance of your car to suit the type of track you're going to race on. Changing and tweaking the cars is incredibly important; having the right setup could easily mean the difference between first and second place. Changing your car's suspension and front- and rear-wing parameters especially change how the vehicle handles.  The control is extremely tight. It takes awhile to get used to how your vehicle handles, but once you do and you start experimenting with the car's settings, the game gets quite fun. The overall physics is a little more real this year; the cars don't slide as much on dry tracks. Keeping the proper racing line and waiting to make a move is a whole lot easier now in Formula One 99, since the cars have been equipped with working rearview wing mirrors. This addition alone makes playing the game a lot more fun, since you no longer have to keep toggling back and forth between the rear- and front-view selection.   Graphically, Formula One 99 is quite impressive. The game features a brand-new engine that gives the game a slightly sharper look than last year's title and, more importantly, eliminates just about all of the glitches, pop-up, and slowdown. Even when playing a two-player split-screen race, the game keeps up a consistent frame rate. The cars and tracks are quite detailed, and the game moves at a realistical fast pace. All this is matched by improved engine sounds that are in fact actual recordings of real F1 racers. In addition, this year's game has commentary by Murray Walker and Martin Brundle, who call the action on the track as it happens. The commentary, while a little dry and repetitive, does add to the overall atmosphere of the game.  Overall, Formula One 99 is a great F1 racing simulation that is sure to wow fans of the sport with its up-to-date drivers and tracks. But more importantly, the game has great control and enough settings to keep any longtime fan of the Formula One series glued to the TV for quite some time.<i>--Ryan Mac Donald</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Hawk lends his technical advice and character likeness to this nine-level title, which is among the better skating titles on the PlayStation. While it is cool to play as Hawk, would-be skate pros can also choose to play as one of eight other skaters. Each character has a different riding style and at least three unique tricks to master.', 'Solo players will skate to win the world championship, with over 100 moves available to score points, including slides, grinds, and landing tricks. A split screen allows players to compete against each other. During this head-to-head mode, you can score style points, race between obstacles, or play tag.

728,G Police 2,"['Factory Sealed', ""Among 1997's crop of Psygnosis games, two stood out from the pack, due to their unique futuristic design and intriguing gameplay: Colony Wars and G-Police. Since Psygnosis released a much-improved sequel to Colony Wars, the next logical step was a sequel to G-Police. While the newest incarnation of G-Police is a better game than the original, it still suffers from some all-too-familiar problems. The storyline picks up where the first game left off. After an all-out war with the crime syndicate, the G-Police's forces are thin and unable to cope with the new gang presence on their planet. To help out, Earth sends a huge detachment of Marines to assist the Gs. From there, things quickly spin out of control as the maniacal leader of the Marine force tries to usurp control of the planet itself. It's your task to patrol the various domes of Callisto and deal with any gang activities or other threatening scenarios as they develop. To accomplish this, you'll take control of four different vehicles - your standard VTOL, a beefed-up VTOL with better firepower and space-faring capabilities, a bipedal mech that can jump 500 feet in the air, and an armored troop-transport. This game's biggest problem is its graphics. While you're certainly in a huge environment, the PlayStation's hardware simply cannot handle the number of polygons required, and pop-up makes a gigantic presence. The game tries to overcome this problem with a fairly creative solution - buildings appear as wire-frames until you're close enough to see textures. Unfortunately, this means that you'll never quite know what you're approaching until you're right on top of it. I cannot stress how frustrating it is to approach a building and get pelted by plasma cannons before you can even see what's firing at you. Aside from the horrendous pop-up, the graphics are acceptable and still very much in the same style as Colony Wars. The sound is actually very well done. Every piece of text in the game is spoken to you, giving you the sense that your wingman is actually about to buy the farm when she buzzes over your com channel. Explosions and weapons all have their own distinct sounds, and the music is generally decent. This game also suffers in the control department. If the VTOLs in this game determined current-day air superiority, we'd have some sad, sad statistics. Simply put, the craft are slow, unresponsive, and almost completely unmaneuverable. Like helicopters or any multidirectional thrust craft, your craft can move independently on five different axes. However, while you can increase your altitude by hovering, you cannot decrease it. So, in practice, you can easily move forward while climbing, but to land you must nose-dive and pull up at the last second. This only adds to the general feeling of frustration and takes all the strategy out of the dogfights in the game. You'll just hover in one spot and pivot around until you get the enemy craft in your sights. G Police 2 makes few improvements over the original and never really overcomes the issues that plagued its predecessor. While the action is somewhat better, and the missions have a slightly increased sense of variety, the game is still rather boring. You'll find that the domes are unnecessarily restrictive and that the buildings on Callisto all look the same - leading you to look at your radar more than at the environment around you. I find it somewhat funny that the final mission takes you off Callisto itself and into a huge space battle with the Marine battle cruisers. This is far and away the best mission of the bunch, and it demonstrates that if you were looking for a futuristic air-combat game, you'd be better off with Colony Wars.<i>--Ben Stahl</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

733,Atomic Bomberman - PC,"['I play console games. That\'s right. I\'ve said it. Despite having been a PC reviewer for seven years, I do occasionally sneak over to a console machine just to take a peek at how the other half lives. And, usually, I\'m not impressed. The one glaring exception would have to be HudsonSoft\'s release of Super Bomberman 2 for the Super Nintendo. Throughout the years, this one simple game has been the pinnacle of what all games should aspire to be - simple to learn, requiring very little in the way of flashy graphics or spectacular sound, and delivering great gameplay and multiplayer competition. I was overwhelmed with excitement when I first heard that a PC version was on its way. Sadly, though, the game just didn\'t live up to my expectations. <P> Like its console predecessors, Interplay\'s Atomic Bomberman is pleasingly simple. You control one of several different colored bombers from an overhead perspective. By clicking your button (the game can be fully customized so this can be any button that suits you) you drop lit bombs that explode after a few seconds. Using these bombs, you must destroy all of your opponents. That\'s it (well, there\'s a little more to it, but that\'s basically it). By collecting icons that are hidden within the walls you can arm your bomber with power-ups, such as additional bombs, more powerful bombs, acceleration, the ability to kick bombs (good for getting out of a tight pinch), and the ability to throw bombs. All in all, if you are a new player you can expect to spend at most five minutes learning how to play. But as you play you\'ll learn tricks and acquire skills that will improve your game. <P> So here\'s the tricky part. The game is actually so simple that most PC users would look at it and say ""shareware"" without ever taking the time to actually play it. Interplay\'s solution to this potential problem was to send in their design teams to add a load of new features and artwork that would enhance the game without losing its overall feel. Unfortunately, they were only partially successful. Some of the game\'s new features are great, such as the addition of hilarious death animations and a bunch of new maps. Others are horrible, like the new icon art and the megs and megs of ""taunts"" that play every time you pick up a power-up. And some are just plain inexplicable, like the inclusion of the golden bomber feature in the single-player mode, but not in the multiplayer mode for which it was designed. But even these changes don\'t really hurt the game - the real coup de grace comes in the poor network support. <P> That\'s right. The most important component of Atomic Bomberman - multiplayer - is also its weakest component. At best, play is jerky and at worst, players get randomly kicked out. There are also really bizarre problems, like adding players who aren\'t really in the game, and awarding wins to players who haven\'t earned them (and not registering those ghost wins on other players\' computers). For a game that revolves around multiplayer competition, this just isn\'t acceptable. <P> On a positive note, Interplay has made some real jumps forward with the game by adding customizable characters, game rules, and more. But Atomic Bomberman is one of this year\'s biggest missed opportunities: PC owners had a chance to not only get introduced to HudsonSoft\'s classic, but to play a title superior to any that had come before it. Sadly, that isn\'t what happened. <i>--Trent C. Ward</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

The three dozen-odd cars are meticulously detailed and wildly creative: You get to drive and destroy everything from a tricked-out '70s low-rider sporting front-mounted jackhammers, to a muscle car crossed with a World War II prop plane, to a dragster, to a dune buggy, and much more. They're not real cars, but they look real enough, especially when you smash them (or into them) and they crumple and crack in all the right places. Then again, the cars in Carmageddon always did look good, although the same couldn't be said for their targets, the lowly pedestrians who were mere 2D sprites in the first game and didn't look right against the 3D cars. But now the pedestrians, comprising a cornucopia of humans and wildlife, join their hunters in the third dimension, which unlocks a world of gory, new opportunities for the player. They'll come apart at the seams, go flying through the air, burst into blood and guts, and worse as you careen into them in every which way, earning money for each and every kill. Were it not for the rather plain-looking tracks and a frame rate that can falter even on high-end systems, Carmageddon II would look entirely excellent. <P> Of course it's tasteless. But if the country can embrace a foul-mouthed and foul-mannered prime-time cartoon show, then it's ready for Carmageddon II. Besides, it's a funny game. You'll pick up dozens of different power-ups that affect the innocent bystanders in absurdly hilarious ways: They'll explode when hit, pop and fly away, dance in place, stumble like drunks, have huge heads, turn huge altogether, turn tiny, turn fat, turn tall, turn skinny, turn completely immortal - you name it. And the carnage is set to the perfectly appropriate music of the quintessential heavy metal band Iron Maiden, as well as a few guitar-heavy instrumental pieces that, while they aren't Maiden, aren't bad. Unfortunately, the other sound effects in the game are only fair, as pedestrian screams and steel wrenching against steel all start to get repetitive fast. <P> In any event, you'll probably be too wrapped up in the game to be bothered. Like the first game, you don't need to follow too many rules. You can race around the track past a series of checkpoints through several laps and end a race, but you'll often find it easier (and a lot more fun) to total all the enemy cars vying to do the same. Either objective is made both challenging and enjoyable thanks to the wacky hyperrealistic physics model behind the game that has cars careening through the air and against buildings and one another at the slightest invitation. You'll find yourself in all sorts of incredible and ridiculous wrecks, often with those hapless pedestrians at the center. Thankfully, you can magically repair or recover your car at the touch of a button, and for a price. And because the collisions rarely force you into a frustrating situation, and the physics model is so open-ended, and there are so many silly power-ups, Carmageddon II ends up being entertaining for a long time. <P> That's not to say it never gets annoying; because of the linear race progression, you'll sometimes get stuck on a timed mission objective that you'll have to replay until you get it right. But the game isn't all that difficult, and a little perseverance should get you past any roadblocks, metaphorical or not. What you're left with, then, is a game that isn't serious at all but instead offers a fun and colorful, albeit predominantly red, environment to drive across, through, or over. Carmageddon II isn't the most ambitious game you'll ever play, but chances are it'll be one of the more enjoyable games you've tried lately. <i>--Greg Kasavin</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

743,Black Dahlia - PC,"['Three major historical phenomena form the basis for the <i>Black Dahlia</i> story line. Although separated in both time and space, these events were linked by more than simple murder. The methodology, the systematic deliberation involved in these murders, and the lack of common reason fascinates and compels us to look deeper into the forces responsible for these acts. <P>First, let us examine the reign of terror carried out in Cleveland by America\'s first modern serial killer. This cunning psychopath, known as the Torso Killer, can be linked to dozens of slayings. Many of his victims were found dismembered and neatly wrapped in newspaper along a stretch of industrial wasteland called Kingsbury Run. He was never apprehended despite an intense--even eerie--manhunt carried out by some of the day\'s top law enforcement officers, including the famous ""Untouchable"" Eliot Ness. The killer\'s activities mysteriously ceased just before the outbreak of World War II, which incidentally is the next major historical event that plays a role in our story. <P>The rise of fascism in Europe and the incomprehensible defeat of both Poland and France at the hands of Nazi Germany caused many to speculate that the Germans had more than a tactical military advantage over its opponents. To some, this led to a conviction that a network of spies and traitors must have played a significant role in Hitler\'s victories; to others, it pointed to supernatural aid. <P>Finally, the third, and in some ways most tragic, piece of history that has inspired our story is the murder of a young actress in Los Angeles, California. <P>Whatever motives these various historical figures may have had, it is not difficult to draw parallels between them. Our plot ties these events, leading from the barbarous madness of the Torso Killer and the murderer of Elizabeth Short to the architects of the Holocaust who nearly succeeded in plunging our world into a new Dark Age. <P>Features: <BR>* An unprecedented freedom of movement within the game\'s 3-D-rendered, ultrarealistic, ""living"" environment <BR>* An intricate, twisting plot line that will keep you guessing right up to the very end <BR>* Over 70 tightly integrated, highly relevant puzzles and thrilling combat sequences will provide challenges for gamers of all tastes <BR>* A truly epic scale that carries the gamer to over 80 locations on two continents over the course of five years <BR>* An exciting cast of professional actors, including Hollywood\'s Dennis Hopper and Teri Garr <BR>* A story that is derived from history and in which every detail has been painstakingly researched', 'Take 2\'s track record in the adventure game genre has been shaky, to say the least. First there was the overhyped and disappointing Hell: A Cyberpunk Thriller, which was followed by the just-plain-terrible Bureau 13, and then by the nearly good Ripper. The last game was a major step forward for the company - while it still emphasized Hollywood production values (the big commercial push was the fact that Christopher Walken starred in it), it actually had bona fide puzzles. The latest offering from the company, Black Dahlia, is yet another step in the right direction; there are some interesting design decisions, a few good puzzles, and some amazing technology. But every positive aspect of Black Dahlia is outweighed by a negative, and what begins as an interesting tale of conspiracy and murder ends up a confused and confusing gore fest of the not-so-supernatural. <P> Black Dahlia loosely deals with the true-life murder of Elizabeth Short, an aspiring actress found brutally murdered in Los Angeles in the mid-1940s. Short\'s obsession with the color black led newspapers at the time to dub her the Black Dahlia. Though the game takes its title from this famously unsolved case, it only touches on the murder, which is simply one minor plot point in a sprawling tale of a Teutonic order trying to lay its hands on a magical gem called, coincidentally enough, the Black Dahlia. <P> The game does an interesting job of tying historical fact to its own fiction. The Cleveland ""Torso Killer"" of the early \'40s plays a part, as does the FBI, the Untouchable Elliot Ness, and almost the whole of the Nazi Party. You take on the role of Jim Pearson, a COI operative investigating possible Nazi conspirators in Cleveland. Your investigation leads you to a much deeper mystery, and you must enlist the aid of your predecessor (played by Dennis Hopper in a minor role), who everyone thinks has gone mad because of his obsession with the supernatural. Up until this point, the game is quite fascinating. The puzzles, while sometimes requiring great leaps of logic, are solid and seem like an actual part of the story. But once everything starts to come together storywise, everything falls apart in the game. <P> First, the story just goes wild and stops making any sense. Your character is plagued by nightmares that start invading his daily life in some of the least impressive horror scenes since Phantasmagoria: A Puzzle of Flesh. The connections between the various divergent elements are all but wrapped up halfway through the game, and you spend the rest of your time simply tracking down the gem in a variety of locales. That is until the final sequence, which not only has little to do with everything that led up to it, but is also a relatively inane and obvious ""homage"" to the finale of Raiders of the Lost Ark. <P> And if lamenting the demise of a promising story weren\'t enough, you\'re faced with some boilerplate puzzles for which the phrase ""tacked-on"" would be a compliment. After the first act of Black Dahlia, there are only three real puzzle types: jigsaw puzzles, lever-moving puzzles, and slider puzzles. There are a few interesting and challenging puzzles scattered about, but the preponderance of ""secret door locks"" just becomes ridiculous. At one point, you must solve two of these in a row. The game then jumps a few years into the future. You\'re immediately faced with three more. It\'s almost as if Agent Pearson has been promoted to ""director of slider puzzle operations."" <P> What makes all of this nonsense more disappointing is that the technology in the game is really good. It uses sort of a ""node"" system (similar to Zork Nemesis) in which you move from one predetermined location to the next, and in these places you can look in any direction. The graphics are nicely rendered and the integration of video with pre-rendered backgrounds in the exploration sequences is really impressive. <P> Adventure gamers who don\'t mind puzzles that are rote and unrelated to the story will probably enjoy the bulk of Black Dahlia. The technology is nice, the story is interesting for a while, and the game is relatively long. But those longing for the days when puzzles were actually a part of the story will probably find Black Dahlia to be just another pretty romp through a bunch of unrelated locales. <i>--Ron Dulin</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

748,Of Light and Darkness: The Prophecy,"['Judgement day has come for Earth, and time is running out. As the Chosen One, you are the only thing standing between the human race and an apocalypse. Saving the world in <i>Of Light and Darkness: The Prophecy</i> primarily consists of redeeming apparitions, ghosts of people who--in life--committed one of the seven deadly sins. The apparitions were summoned by a Dark Lord named Gar Hob. After 29 successful redemptions, you face Hob himself in a face-to-face showdown.<P> <i>Of Light and Darkness</i> poses some tricky problems and has one feature not usually seen in first-person role-playing games: players are running against a clock. Failure to redeem apparitions on a tight schedule brings on doomsday with alacrity. As a result of this deadline, the game has a repetitive element. Once you understand how to redeem apparitions--a fairly complex procedure--the action moves swiftly. The level of difficulty does not remain static, however, because apparitions become increasingly dangerous. Though the stakes are high, the grim tone is leavened with stunning graphics and random witty touches. (The movement icon, for example, is a pair of mismatched socks.)<P> Winning this game takes dedication and quick footwork, but players will enjoy racing the Clock of Judgement to the final confrontation with Hob. <i>--Alyx Dellamonica</i>', 'Do you think that the adventure genre has gotten into a rut? Has finding objects, combining them into unlikely contraptions, and using them in implausible ways become a bit too routine? If so, Tribal Dreams\' strikingly original Of Light and Darkness may be the game for you. Which is not to say that it delivers a fully satisfying experience: It does not. But there is so much creativity in the game - from the ""real-time adventure"" mechanics to the evocative design - that it is a must-see experience for most experienced gameplayers, even if you decide not to work through to the end. <P> You begin the game in a netherworld between the realms of light and dark, facing a demonic jack-in-the-box and listening to a court proceeding of some kind. It gets no less strange from here. Apparently, you are ""The Chosen One"" upon whom the world depends to rescue it from an end-of-millennium-style cataclysm. You are dropped into a strange village of buildings and rooms, many of which represent the seven deadly sins. Apocalypse and end-of-time tales from the full range of world cultures are quoted in some of the rooms. You collect variously colored orbs, pyramid-shaped portals, and odd artifacts like a necklace or saber. Apparitions appear in the form of floating death masks, each demanding its own artifact back from you. The specters represent 31 of history\'s most notorious evil-doers, from Wa-No-Te, a pernicious womanizer from Mongolia (c. 4117 BC) to contemporary serial killer John Wayne Gacy. Occasionally, a colored flash will fill your screen, and at other times a hologram will appear near you in which a lovely lady named Angel (played by Lolita Davidovich) is exchanging world-class obscure dialogue with Gar Hob, ""The Dark Lord of the Seventh Millennium"" (played by James Woods). <P> The first puzzle in Of Light and Darkness is simply figuring out what the hell is going on! Several readings of the lengthy but evasive manual reveal a great deal of back story, but no concise, clear outline of what exactly all of these things mean, what you are to do with them, or how to do it. Most adventures do require that you figure out first what a puzzle wants you to do before you actually tackle it (a la Myst). But of Light and Darkness is just merciless in its obscurity. The manual reads as if it is missing key explanatory pages - or was written by a post-structuralist literary critic. Only after commiserating with other befuddled players was it apparent to me that the gameplay is quite straightforward. <P> Your job is to redeem the apparitions in each of three levels. To do so, you must find the apparition\'s signature object, deduce which is its deadly sin, and go to the appropriate room, luring the apparition in as well. Then you must combine the object with the right blend of orb colors (according to which was the last color to flash in your face). When you activate the correct combination in the right spot, you will redeem the apparition. Once you have determined the appropriate item, sin, and color for an apparition, you must figure out how to lure it to the right ""sin room"" for redemption. Using orbs and portals judiciously becomes a unique strategic element. <P> Within an hour or two of play, however, OLAD begins to seem like a massive, elaborate game of Clue: matching the right weapon, room, and culprit. The new levels (which really just open up new rooms in the same village setting) do add some doors that need unlocking with specific items and toss in some different-colored Orbs, but the gameplay remains the same throughout. <P> Along the way, more pop-up videos remind you that Angel needs saving, if for no other reason than to spare her, and us, from further pretentious conversations with James Woods. More spirits pour in throughout play, and you must clear each of three levels in order to experience the endgame, a special set of puzzles, in which you activate colors in a specific order, to defeat Gar Hob. <P> The ""real time"" label is misleading and shouldn\'t deter gamers who hate to be rushed. You do have to redeem the apparitions before Armageddon overcomes you, but there are ways of extending that time limit, like flashing a group of apparitions with white light. The gameplay is actually quite cerebral, but with a pleasant jolt of adrenaline. And before playing each level in earnest, you can take a tour of the locations without running down the clock, which helps quite a bit. The masks of history\'s great hit men follow you about the village, blocking your way from some paths and demanding their stolen items back. At the third level of play, just running into one of these death masks is enough to blow your game. <P> Graphically and mechanically, the game works beautifully. Artist Gil Bruvel lends the village and its renditions of sinfulness an appropriate foreboding atmosphere as well as some humor. Pride is represented by a spotlit microphone on an empty stage, while an animated face in Anger barks, ""Go away!"" Movement is point to point (similar to Zork Nemesis) with animated transitions and 360-degree spinning at each location. Luckily, movement is fluid and responsive, since you will need to do some sprints between locations. Once you get a handle on the rules, gameplay has a unique flow. You are darting between locations to fight the clock but also have to keep track of what is currently in inventory as well as what needs to be done to redeem the next apparition. <P> Of Light and Darkness is the sort of game that is so offbeat and uneven, so obviously a matter of individual taste, that even a merciless reviewer like me is timid about casting a summary judgment. I found the game ultimately unsatisfying because its many fine parts fight one another rather than cohere into a single, compelling gameplay experience. The Clue-like puzzle solving is novel and refreshing in an adventure game, but it becomes a tedious one-trick pony after the first level. Redeeming each apparition brings only its disappearance and a short speech. The televised storyline pops in on occasion, and the scripting and acting here are very good. But the gameplay and plot feel as alienated from one another as the televised cutscenes make them appear. Neither seems to fit with the other. <P> Especially out of place are some of the game\'s edutainment elements. You need to consult the manual\'s historical profiles regularly in order to identify the apparitions and get clues about the nature of their sins. This is one instance where having the manual online would have contributed to the flow of the game. And in each sin room an officious female voice pretty much kills the moody atmosphere with quotes from religious prophecy. Too often, the game feels like Where in the Apocalypse Is Carmen Sandiego? And after seeing the cutscenes and solving the puzzles, I was not at all convinced that this melange of religious references and floating masks had anything of interest to say about the end of time, evil, or much else. Once Gar Hob is banished in the final cutscene, a cute clip ends the game, again breaking the game\'s dominant tone and undercutting any seriousness of purpose here. <P> At its best, Of Light and Darkness will remind you of the classic TV series The Prisoner. It can be artfully disorienting and promise hidden depths of meaning. But at its worst, it seems more like the second season of Twin Peaks, when the obscurity gets self-serving, and the payoff is meager compared with its initial pretensions. The unorthodox gameplay, while not varied, is very refreshing. As an experiment, Of Light and Darkness is fascinating. But as an engrossing game experience, the sum just isn\'t equal to its parts. <i>--Steve Smith</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

751,Star Trek: Starfleet Academy,"['""The most anticipated 3-D SPACE SIM of the year""-Computer Gaming World""', 'I\'m not really sure why Interplay decided to start publicizing Starfleet Academy nearly three years before its eventual release, but one thing\'s for sure: When you start the hype machine that far in advance, the final product had better deliver all the goods as promised, and then some. Unfortunately for Trek fans and gamers whose appetites have been constantly whetted over the past months, Starfleet Academy just isn\'t up to the task. <P> In all fairness to the folks who worked on Starfleet Academy, part of the reason for the long incubation process was that the project was put on hold while the game\'s producer worked on other titles. But that doesn\'t change the fact that Starfleet Academy looks and plays no better than space combat games from two years ago - and when expectations are as high as they were for this game, that\'s not gonna cut it. <P> Starfleet Academy puts you in the Federation uniform of the sheepish David Forester, who\'s just arrived at Starfleet Academy\'s Command College in San Francisco. Forester is the commander of a group of cadets with a lot of potential - and a lot of emotional baggage. Two team members get into a squabble at the very first team meeting, and that\'s just the first of a series of problems involving each and every member of your crew. Add to this the appearance of a reactionary group at the Academy called the Vanguard, who believe all the Federation\'s problems with the Klingons and Romulans can be solved through brutal retaliation - and the fact that one of your team members sympathizes with this isolationist group - and you can see these aren\'t going to be carefree school days. <P> In addition to keeping your cadets on track, you\'ll also meet Star Trek luminaries such as Hikari Sulu, Pavel Chekhov, and of course the legendary James T. Kirk. All the scenes involving characters at the Academy are handled with full motion video, something of a letdown for those under the impression that the game would give you a chance to move about your quarters or throughout the Academy. And interaction is limited to selecting dialogue responses and then sitting back to see how well you chose. <P> The acting quality ranges from highly polished (Sulu, Chekhov, and Kirk) to competent (Forester and his fellow cadets) to downright uninspired (some of the enemies you face during simulator missions). There\'s actually a pretty decent little mystery that unfolds as you progress deeper into the game, but it\'s just not that compelling a game because the FMV format makes you feel as though you\'re watching a story rather than taking an active part in its solution. <P> This design probably wouldn\'t be an issue if the Starship simulator got your blood pumping. But here again Starfleet Academy falls short - and it\'s not just because all the media hype made gamers expect too much. Interplay was faced with a dilemma here: If the simulator were too ""realistic,"" all the captain could do is bark out orders to his bridge crew - not very exciting stuff. The other option was to go for more of a traditional space combat experience, which puts Starfleet Academy up against games like Wing Commander, Privateer 2, Darklight Conflict, and others. And on that level, Starfleet Academy just doesn\'t pack much of a punch. <P> For starters, you have to run through the rigmarole of allocating damage control teams and adjusting energy settings in anticipation of combat before every mission. This busywork could have been eliminated easily by giving you the option to save several configurations for damage control and energy allocation (full combat, strong tractor beam, strong sensors, and so forth) and simply load the one you want to use. <P> Once you get into a scrape, you\'ll find there\'s no way to look to the left, right, or rear - a serious drawback in a game that\'s little more than a cosmic dogfight - nor are there any external views. Because you\'ve only got two weapons to work with regardless of which class ship you\'re given, it doesn\'t take long for combat to become little more than a routine. About all that breaks up the monotony is the occasional use of the tractor beam or transporter, or the thrill of being able to fire a four-photon spread instead of just two. True, you have to make dialogue choices and command decisions that determine the outcome of the mission, but with very few exceptions the correct responses are pretty obvious. When they\'re not, don\'t bother asking your crew for its input - there\'s no way to query anyone for his opinion unless it\'s offered as a dialogue selection. <P> Another disappointment comes in the visual department. Graphics for ships and explosions are merely adequate in the non-Direct3D version, and though the Direct3D version looks noticeably better, that\'s not saying a whole lot. In short, it looks good, but not great. <P> Because this is a Star Trek game, there\'ll undoubtedly be a few players who\'ll be more than satisfied with what Starfleet Academy has to offer. But gamers who expect a top-notch game to go along with the Star Trek trimmings are likely to be disappointed. <i>--Chris Gregson</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Like the old movie Death Race 2000, Carmageddon allows the drivers to accumulate points not merely by skill shown on one of the 36 race tracks, but by the amount (and type) of pedestrians the driver is able to run over while racing.', '""Members of the public, you now have one minute to reach Minimum Safe Distance."" Truly, that\'s one of the greatest opening lines of dialogue ever recorded for a racing game.', 'Carmageddon touches that particular collective nerve that fuses the wholesome popularity of the All-American Racing Game with the homicidal singularity of the 70s cult film [<a href=""http://www.mcn.net/~netrencher/dr2k.html"">Death Race 2000</a>] into an onscreen experience that can only be compared to the kind of automotive mayhem that a five-year-old American male wreaks with his Matchbox and Hot Wheels cars.', ""The object: Win the race. The motive: Greed. The Rules: None whatsoever. Clear all the specified race checkpoints, destroy all the opposing racecars, or vehicularly murder every last pedestrian bystander within a three-mile radius. It doesn't matter; nobody cares... with the possible minor exception of the pedestrians."", ""Carmageddon uses a ranking system wherein players start at number 99 and move up, painfully and violently, in rank via a series of six-car races through more than 36 circuits - through the circuits, under them, and in some cases quite a considerable number of feet over them. The game is playable as a cockpit-view racer, but the third-person, follow-cam view is a vastly better way to witness the action, which ranges from the dead-on realistic to the absolutely ridiculous and back again without warning. From the go-flag, the competing cars are at each other (1,000 bonus points to whomever manages to cream the flag-waver on the way out), and for the first few moments the gameplay is usually little more than a dense column of outlandishly-designed 3-D vehicles (hopped-up hearses, low-rider Carz That Go Boom, banana-yellow stylized vehicular sharks, and nitro-burnin' dragsters, in addition to some 20 other types) all clashing and sparking and shrieking for pole position (the designers obviously channeled a lot of time into finding really unpleasant, metallic scraping sounds, some of which will put the sensitive gamer's teeth on edge with barely-formed thoughts of the dentist). Every car here can hit the century mark within a few seconds off the line, and the problems begin immediately."", 'Usually it\'s something like this: One car will break away to one side (either accidentally or with lots of help), begin to slip into a screaming spin, and instantly trigger a chain-reaction meta-collision involving every car on the road, most of the nearby pedestrians and possibly even some of the local livestock - and if nobody takes the hint, you can start the festivities yourself by love-tapping your lane neighbor, cranking the steering wheel or jamming on the brakes for no good reason. The result is berserk, absurd, epic, and comical at the same time - bright, candy-colored racecars sliding into walls, colliding with dense, metallic crunches, pinwheeling up icy slopes, spiraling through the air like two-ton footballs, plowing red swaths through clusters of screaming pedestrians, obliterating cows, plummeting off the sides of bridges, landing on top of each other and getting points for all of it (including cunning stunt and self-explanatory piledriver bonuses). You also never know if some joker held off on the accelerator and hung back there until he could get a good, well-timed ram at whomever may have survived the opening debacle in the most vulnerable condition - it\'s like an evening with the entirety of the [<a href=""http://www.wwf.com"">World Wrestling Federation</a>], only without the same sense of personal safety and moral depth. And this is almost always before you\'ve cleared the first checkpoint. Sometimes you won\'t even ever see the first checkpoint.', 'Of course, once you\'ve escaped this messy opening, you can race against the clock to complete the circuit (picking up the odd extra few seconds here and there by picking off an old lady crossing the street), or you can concentrate on turning around, finding the rest of the competitors and destroying them. There are no ranged weapons here (with the exception of an anti-pedestrian ray gun power-up); all the combat is purely kinetic, and what promised to start as an honest race can degenerate into a series of jousts at 150 mph. Interplay claims that the ""vehicles display accurate driving physics and realistic collision damage,"" and this is partly true - cars can do sideslips, bootleggers, J-turns, etc. - but what they don\'t tell you is that this realism only holds true at speeds of less that 20 game-miles-per-hour; beyond that, the collisions are catastrophic, the results ludicrous, with vehicles slamming off sloped terrain (or other cars) and flying for the game equivalent of a quarter of a mile. And, of course, there are bonus points for especially wild stunts, intended or not. The impacts, too, are beyond human or vehicular endurance. No matter - the point is, it\'s fun.', ""The points you earn translate immediately to money, which can be used for on-the-fly (sometimes literally) repairs. Nobody cares how far in debt you go, as long as you come out with a positive bank balance when the dust settles and the blood dries. And again, fun is the point here - if you're not having fun in Carmageddon, it's your own fault. Drivers can go off-road, explore underground caverns and quite a bit of the local airspace, short-cut, cheat, lay in ambush, trawl for power-ups (some useful, like time-adds, and some just plain silly, like the dreaded pinball mode), go human-hunting or even - if the mood strikes them - try to win the race the right way, by completing the circuit in record time."", ""Even those with very fast systems will be astonished at the load time for each track - upwards of thirty seconds, even with a medium install (alas, it's not even an interesting thirty seconds, just the same, static image that will likely become one of the biggest gripes for players). Also, the handling differences between cars often come down to issues of key-lag more than anything else. But this is not a racing sim by any stretch of the imagination. If you can keep that in mind, you shouldn't be disappointed. Carmageddon is visceral, violent, vehicular fun, no strings attached, no artificial morals or ethics added, and no artificial colors - just black, blue, and red all over. <i>--Chris Hudak</i> <br />--<i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc.

But it can be considered by the same criteria we judge games by: graphics, sound, value, and so forth. Unlike many of the music games that have shown up throughout the last year or so - Parappa, Um Jammer Lammy, and Konami's Bemani series, to name a few - MTV: MG is a music-making tool that attempts to take what PC music-editing and music-creating programs let you do full scale and brings the experience to the novice consumer who happens to own a PlayStation.  It works like this: You pop in the Music Generator disc and choose to create a song. By hitting the circle button on your control pad, you can select from a list of menu items, including what you need to get started: the riff library, which includes about 4,500 samples. In this section, you choose from beats, drums, vocal samples, melodies, bass lines, and so forth, and you place the riffs on the blank score. You then build your song (which we can't tell you how to do here - just be creative), checking and editing it as you go, then saving it when you're finished.  This mode is intuitive and simple, and if you bear in mind your limited memory capacity before you get too far into your song, you will be pleased with what you are able to create so quickly and effortlessly. But the real fun and, likewise, the real downfall of the program appears when you try the more advanced maneuvers. For example, you can record samples from audio CDs by swapping out the disc with the CD of your choice and then following simple commands that pop up on your screen. Once you record the audio you want, it's immediately stored in the sampled riff palette until you move it, save it, and access it later. While this sounds like a great idea and certainly rounds out the program, it's extremely limited. Likewise, the intuitive interface takes a plunge once you start looking around for your newly sampled riff. But the true disappointment, which should come as no surprise, is that you can only save seconds of audio before you run out of memory entirely. And the more self-sampled audio you use, the fewer library riffs you can slip in. You'll realize right away that the ideal setting for intense music creation is not the 2MB RAM PlayStation. In addition, the program, albeit intuitive, is not too attractive. Graphically, it's dull, even if it works. There's a video-editing option as well, wherein you synch up basic moving images and patterns to the song you created. You can also set the program to automate these videos. The problem is, once again, memory space. You're very limited by what you can do, and in the end, these video clips end up looking like low-budget college-computer-lab projects... at best. On the positive side, the game doesn't pretend to woo sound-savvy music editors or individuals with tons of mixing experience. Likewise, it doesn't tell you to ditch the PC editors and use this instead. MTV: Music Generator simply provides the experience of mixing for those who likely won't invest a couple hundred dollars in the very affordable and just as intuitive PC music editor Sonic Foundry Acid or any others, for that matter.  And what it promises to do, it does it well. The basic functions are simple enough so that even someone with no music-making experience can get the hang of making a moderately complex song. And if you want to stretch the basics, you can. You can edit riffs, split riffs, as well as play around with keys, tone bending, envelopes, fades, and you name it - memory permitting.  There's a multiplayer jam mode, too. This option lets you play turn-based one-to-four-player sessions that has each of you managing certain beats, rhythms, or melodies to form one complete song. Half the fun is figuring it out, but it's not the kind of game or experience you'll likely go back to often. But it was surprising to see a program like this include a shared experience, so there's value in the inventiveness, if not in the actually gameplay.  For its price, MTV: Music Generator is worth it. It's sort of like the run on Casio keyboards in the early '80s - every house seemed to have one, and most owners didn't have a clue what to do with them. You pounded out basic songs and threw in some drumbeats. This program is more advanced than that and quite a bit more fun. If you're a serious musician and tool around on your PC, you're probably going to be frustrated or bored, as the RAM is obviously limited and the library is nothing you haven't seen or used before. And frankly, there are better libraries elsewhere. But for PlayStation owners who just want a fun, addictive music-making tool, you'll likely be pretty amused, if not downright mesmerized. At least long enough to justify the cost.<i>--Lauren Fielder</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

760,Space Invaders N64,"['small sticker on front and sticker on back label', ""The year was 1978. A simple, black-and-white game came out that would set the standard for shooters for years to come. That game was Space Invaders. Not only did it spawn a few sequels of its own (including a pinball machine), but other game makers quickly cloned it and made improvements to its gameplay. Activision is continuing its big retro kick with an updated version of Taito's classic. But can a game as simple as this succeed in today's market? (Hint: The answer isn't yes.) This new version of Space Invaders follows the basic concept of the old versions: Rows of small alien ships move from side to side across the screen. The ships drop down a row every time they reach either edge of the screen. If they land, you die. If they shoot you, you die. While the original Space Invaders stuck to this one type of level, later games - like the arcade game Super Space Invaders '91 - added weapon power-ups, shields, different types of alien ships, bonus stages, and bosses into the mix. Activision's game follows SSI '91's lead very closely. It also tries to inject a bit more plot into the game via opening and closing cutscenes. Also, the game takes you from the outer outposts of Pluto all the way back to Earth. Each planet has ten levels, the last of which is a boss level. A new alien ship is introduced in each world. Some of them shoot diagonally, some of them you must hit twice to kill, and some dive at you after they've been hit. The power-up system works off these different aliens. To earn a special shot, you must hit four of the same aliens in a row. Each alien type delivers a different special shot. This gives the game an almost puzzle-game-type feel at times, since you'll want to earn a special shot, then use it to kill four more aliens, which will give you another special shot, and so on. The game's biggest problem is its lack of difficulty. Anyone with a bit of shooter skill should be able to whip through the entire game in less than 90 minutes. The bosses are occasionally difficult, but you'll have built up so many extra lives by that point that it won't really matter. The original Space Invaders is also hidden in the game. The graphics are quite boring, and they don't really give the game a retro feel at all. Other than one of the end-level bosses, which was taken from the original Space Invaders cabinet art, none of the design in the game bears any resemblance to the original game. Also, the music and sound don't have any ties to the original thumping noise of the 1978 classic.  Space Invaders is a game different enough to cancel any feelings of nostalgia, yet it isn't good enough to stand on its own. If classic games are what you're after, get a pack of classic games, or better yet, find a big arcade that still cares about the old stuff. This pretender is no substitute for the original.<i>--Jeff Gerstmann</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

761,Descent Freespace: The Great War,"['Manual for FREESPACE THE GREAT WAR computer game', 'Over the years a variety of space-combat simulations have been released, but none of them has been as polished or even remotely as interesting as LucasArts\' X-Wing series or Origin Systems\' Wing Commander series, both of which are still going strong. With the enticing capabilities of 3D graphics hardware support and a general resurgence in science fiction themes, it was only a matter of time before gaming companies would, once again, try to break LucasArts\' and Origin Systems\' collective stranglehold over the genre. At last a worthy challenger has arrived. Descent: Freespace is one of a number of recently released or announced space-sim titles from developers who are better known for creating successful gaming series in other genres. <P> When the plot of Descent: Freespace begins, the ever-warmongering Terrans are in the midst of a 14-year misunderstanding with the Vasudans. While the Vasudans and the Terrans are fairly evenly matched, they quickly put aside their differences when a third race appears, the technologically superior Shivans. Although a rebel Vasudan faction continues to harass the new Vasudan-Terran alliance, the main threat comes from the Shivans and their monstrous capital ship, the Lucifer. From the opening animated cutscene, Descent: Freespace does an excellent job at maintaining the aura of the Shivans as a mysterious, unstoppable force. When you first encounter the Shivans, you won\'t even be able to target their jet-black ships, and the weapons that seemed so impressive against the Vasudans will barely make an impression on the Shivans and their seemingly invulnerable shields. At first you have to avoid direct conflicts with the superior Shivans and instead embark on missions to steal their technology in order to improve the capabilities of your ships. In fact, there\'s a real X-COM feel to the game, as you uncover the mysteries of the Shivans and constantly improve the technology of your ships and weaponry. <P> Very little about Descent: Freespace is entirely original, but the developers did an admirable job at extracting the best features from previous spaces sims. Everything from the ""sink the behemoth"" branching plot to the stylish interface, mission briefings, and graphics appears to be plucked from other games of the genre, but improved. In many ways, the graphics closely resemble those used in Wing Commander Prophecy and make especially good use of colored lighting, shielding, lens flare, and engine blast effects. <P> Combat in Descent: Freespace also more closely resembles the fast-paced, missile-blasting, afterburner sliding frag fests of the Wing Commander series than the World War II style of combat favored by the Star Wars sims. Descent: Freespace is probably the most missile-intensive game yet seen in the genre, but fortunately single missile hits aren\'t usually too destructive to your ship. Afterburners can only be utilized in short bursts, requiring you to tactically reserve them for when they are most useful.<P> The customizable interface of Descent: Freespace is outstanding - easily the best yet seen in the genre. The interface was clearly designed to make useful information, such as the status of escorted ships, the direction and the distance of approaching missiles, mission objectives, and the condition of your wingmen, constantly available on your screen. <P> The plot of Descent: Freespace advances through animated cutscenes, periodic ""news"" updates on the status of the war, as well as through mission briefings and the occasional scripted mission event. Overall, these methods combine to provide a compelling, if somewhat disjointed, storyline.<P> There are approximately 30 single-player missions in the branching campaign and 20 multiplayer missions. The mission objectives are nicely varied and include ""kill \'em all"" missions, stealthy inspection missions, a mission that resembles a giant game of Asteroids, and some epic capital ship confrontations near the end of the game. Descent: Freespace automatically saves after each campaign mission, and you can\'t independently save the game, which is a bit disappointing, since it prevents you from exploring the various campaign ""branches"" without restarting the entire campaign.<P> Multiplayer support for up to 12 players is included either through a TCP/IP network or the Internet through the free Parallax Online servers. Parallax Online keeps detailed pilot statistics and is an extremely streamlined service, with an intuitive interface and seamless integration with the multiplayer interface of Descent: Freespace. Unfortunately, even after two patches, most gamers will find a multiplayer game of Descent: Freespace over the Internet to be completely unplayable due to lag. Unlike first-person shooter games, where an environment\'s walls and a player\'s line of sight will naturally limit the number of objects that a client has to keep track of at any one time, the open areas of space-combat simulations have historically proven very difficult to use as online multiplayer arenas. Multiplayer support was eventually removed from Wing Commander Prophecy because Origin wasn\'t satisfied that it would work well, and even earlier in that game\'s development Internet multiplayer support was removed. Even X-Wing vs. Tie Fighter limits multiplayer support to four players over Microsoft\'s Internet Gaming Zone. In that context, it\'s astonishing that Interplay and Volition were, almost until the game was released, advertising Descent: Freespace as capable of supporting 16 players online, when in fact the retail version of the game is currently incapable of even adequately supporting two players each using 56K modems. <P> Still, unless you are only looking for a multiplayer dogfighting area (in which case you\'ll be doubly disappointed, since deathmatch support was removed late in development entirely, in favor of cooperative and team vs. team missions) there\'s a lot to like about Descent: Freespace. It\'s a noble effort to both cannibalize the best elements of classics of the genre and also provide a number of refreshing innovations. While Descent: Freespace isn\'t quite the standout game it could have been, it\'s a welcome step in the right direction for the genre. Highly recommended. <i>--Desslock</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

765,Redneck Rampage - PC,"['Redneck rampage and redneck rampage rounds again Arkansas Games', 'Just when it seemed that publishers had shipped every possible variant of the first-person 3D shooter, Interplay has pulled the genre from the swamp. <P> And they did it with redneck jokes. Redneck Rampage packages the Duke Nukem 3D engine with a low-concept theme - invading aliens are cloning backcountry hicks - that could have very easily fallen apart. But Redneck Rampage works on several levels - as a shooter, adventure, and humor title. This is a clever, fun, and challenging game with great characters, crisp sound effects, and inventive - though at times very frustrating - gameplay. <P> The backwoods deep south is near-universally the butt of jokes, and the game delivers them through the perspective of Leonard, the game\'s rampaging hero. In the opening scene, the Jim Varney-lookalike cocks his pistol and says he\'s ""out to open up a can o\' whup ass."" His goal is to kill off the aliens who snatched a pig right out of the bed of his pickup and, it turns out, are starting their invasion of earth by cloning the moronic local folk. The aliens in the first few levels are chirping, feces-flinging gremlins, while the local yokels greet you with shotguns and rifles. Vicious dogs attack without provocation, with the exception of one mutt that remains frozen in mid-leap until you get his attention with a bullet or crowbar. <P> Though the tabloid alien-abduction plot feels a bit dated, there\'s more than enough splatter and gags to compensate. The player sends Leonard into a sewage treatment plant, dairy, junkyard, mobile-home park (complete with a nasty tornado problem), and other locales. He must find the skeleton keys that help him work his way to the nose-picking, crotch-adjusting Bubba and whap him upside the head with a crowbar to complete each level. Our hero\'s arsenal includes weapons such as a scattergun, a dynamite crossbow, and a gun that launches ripsaw blades. Thanks to the Build engine, he can blow up cows, trash jukeboxes, smash windows, and generally leave destruction in his wake, just as Duke could. <P> The game\'s humor works. Xatrix Entertainment invested the time to load Redneck up with endless little in-jokes and details - the game is a rich, twisted parody of the deep south. Moon Pie snacks become Cow Pie power-ups, and Leonard has a repertoire of post-killing punchlines such as ""You plays with the bull, ya gets the horns."" Other touches of humor are more subtle. If Leonard dives into a well and swims along an underwater tunnel, he\'ll come up for air in the outhouse. Health is restored by drinking moonshine and cheap-ass whiskey - but watch your intake! Too much \'shine and you\'ll be lurching out of control. While Leonard can ""take a quick pee"" to sober up a bit, more obvious scatological gags fall flat - including the straining, splashing sound effects that start up whenever he nears a toilet. <P> Farts aside, the game\'s sound effects are sharp, from the echoing crack of an automatic rifle report, to the crash of pins in the bowling alley, to Leonard\'s painful ""ow!"" when he\'s hit or bitten by a giant mosquito. The Reverand Horton Heat pumps out of jukeboxes in several parts of the game, and Mojo Nixon and The Beat Farmers are included on the game\'s soundtrack. <P> While shoot-outs are fun, a strong adventure element underscores the gameplay. Leonard must open fridges, run machinery, climb hidden ladders, and ride concealed elevators. The player can easily get stuck, wandering endlessly in search of the well-hidden key that will open a door and advance a level. Interplay is likely doing great business with their 1-900 hint line. Controls can be frustrating to get the hang of, especially when the player is trying to time a crucial split-second jump from a wrecked car or a bale of hay. One such jump demanded 15 or 20 practice runs. On every other level, this tight maneuvering, combined with the sometimes too well concealed skeleton keys, stalls out the otherwise addictive gameplay. <P> Overlooking the controls and difficulty issues, this is a fresh, funny, inventive take on a formula that grows more tired every time the FedEx guy shows up at the GameSpot offices with a box. If you liked Duke Nukem - and you\'re ready for a twist - you\'ll find Redneck a hoot. <i>--James Glave</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Your mission is to keep Woody the Cowboy from falling into the hands of a toy collector. Film favorites Hamm the pig, Rex the dinosaur, and Slinky the dog are back to help you save your friend in this 3-D-based action game.', ""While movie-based games are always a hit-or-miss venture, this title does look promising. A quick peek at this game reveals that it succeeds in preserving the charm and humor that characterizes the hit film. The cute, colorful design of the various game levels does not come at the expense of gameplay. You'll have to travel through 15 levels and five nasty bosses, including the evil Zurg, to get to the end of this graphically impressive game. Fortunately, you'll have several special weapons to help your cause, including rocket jet boots, an arm laser, moon spring boots, and a grappling hook. Young and old Disney fans will definitely want to give this game a try."", 'The N64 version of Toy Story 2 surprisingly doesn\'t win any graphics competitions against the PlayStation game, and actually falls short of the 32-bit companion. The gameplay, however, salvages what the visual side is lacking. Unfortunately, the lack of animated cutscenes from the film is sorely missed. Part of what makes the Toy Story 2 game experience fun is that it\'s like interacting with the movie. Still screens with oversimplified text just doesn\'t seem the Pixar way. Toy Story 2 is something like n-Space\'s Rugrats: Search for Reptar in that it has mission-based levels set off a hub, which, in both cases, is a house, and that it follows the film\'s scenarios to a T. Toy Story 2 is larger, with about 15 levels (three levels within five zones) you can play through them either as quickly and easily or as difficultly as you wish. By picking up all the items and solving all  the puzzles, Toy Story 2 has a bit more complexity than Rugrats, which probably exists more in the ""good for kids"" category. Toy Story 2 wants to appeal to a broad range of gamers, not just kids, and this is obvious in its level design. In each of the levels you have several objectives. You have puzzles to solve, tokens to collect, enemies to fight, and items to find - in addition to a boss fight at the end of zone. However, once you complete one objective, you have the option to move on, fight the boss, and work your way to the next zone. It\'s usually easy to acquire 50 tokens in a level, as they\'re scattered about the environment, often lending clues as to which obstacles you can jump on, and so forth. You can also pick up tokens from dead toys you\'ve destroyed with your Buzz Lightyear laser. Eventually you must go back and replay levels, if you haven\'t picked up all the goods, as you\'ll need a decent-sized stash of Pizza Planet tokens to advance toward the final stages. But as in any game, you learn certain skills as you progress that will make stages that had seemed difficult in the beginning much easier. The graphics, however, were disappointing. Not bad, but not what you\'d hope for from the N64 - given what developers started out with in the Toy Story motif. With movie license games, it\'s easy to assume that the PlayStation/N64 trade-off, should both versions exist, will be graphics for the N64 and sound and fmv for the PlayStation. This is not the case. The PlayStation version actually has both, and the N64 offering was pretty weak. Without scenes from the film, the movie\'s energy is gone. The look and feel is there, but the mood is not. The environments are colorful; they\'re mostly easy to get around in and free of depth perception. But the color seemed a little flat on the N64, even with the same nice touches found in the PlayStation version, such as Buzz\'s reflection being visible from inside his space helmet when you\'re in targeting or close-up mode. The cameras presented a bit of a problem. You could choose passive or active cameras, with either you in charge of the camera or the camera in charge of itself. You decide. What\'s good is that you can change between active and passive cameras on the fly during gameplay. You\'ll probably find yourself doing this quite often in the beginning. When the active camera is agreeable, it\'s suspiciously good. But then, seconds later, you\'ll find yourself cornered in an alley, pushing a box next to a chair that you must jump on to leap onto a scale that will in turn send you soaring into the air. This isn\'t fun with a camera whipping around you like a mosquito, yet you\'ve too much going on to manage your camera while you navigate your jumps, grabs, and leaps. This becomes a problem far too often, dragging the game\'s overall score down a bit. It\'s certainly not the worst camera system out there, and you will get used to it and probably settle on the active camera at some point, cursing your way through the game. It proves the game to be yet another notch away from being a kid\'s game. For a movie with generous voice-over already in the can, you\'d expect an overload of catch phrases and one-liners in the licensed game. This is not the case, and Crystal Dynamics could learn a thing or two for Gex from this one. It\'s a simple model: Less is more. The voices from the film are intact, but they\'re not out of hand, at least Buzz\'s voice isn\'t. It does get a bit annoying when Hamm whines, ""Buzz, come \'ere"" the entire time you\'re in his territory. And Sarge\'s pep talk gets old pretty fast. But for the most part, the catch phrases are few and far between - just enough to make it interesting without driving you to the brink. And the music? Toy Story music. \'Nuff said.<i>--Lauren Fielder</i>--<i>Copyright  1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

In response, game developers seem to be in a scramble to give classic arcade games a face-lift and a release on current consoles.

You turn countless centipedes into mushrooms, blast spiders, and avoid touching anything dangerous."", ""The control of this game takes a little getting used to, but once you're there, you'll enjoy it. Instead of being limited to the bottom third of the screen, you can now roam about the entire 3D environment. Thankfully, the game engine was well designed, making strafing easy, so you can literally fly circles around your enemies. And although the centipedes enter from one side of the screen, they'll always make their way towards you. So if you find yourself running out of space, simply reverse your direction, and voila - more room. You'll learn to use this to your advantage, steering the centipedes toward wherever you need them to go. In addition, The Shooter can jump, so you can hop mushrooms or even climb ledges for special power-ups."", ""The graphics in this game are adequate. The game sports three different views: a top-down view, an up-close-and-personal view from directly behind your craft, and a hybrid middle ground. From the top-down view, things are simple and fairly bland. The graphics really come into their own when you switch to the close-up view, where the 'pedes start to look menacing and dangerous, houses look like more than just squares, and the Wees you rescue look much more alive. Everything takes on a cartoony look in this view, as the enemies have huge balloon eyes, the mushrooms pop out of the ground when you shoot the centipedes, and the Wee people look very elfish. The worlds all have their distinct look and are well designed - if it weren't for the mind-numbing repetition, they'd stand out better."", ""Think of a generic techno beat, and you've got the soundtrack to this game. While it's not really intrusive, it's nothing you'll turn up the volume to hear. The sound effects are carried over from the original and help the nostalgic effect this game is trying so hard to achieve."", 'Bundled into the package is an arcade mode, which presents you with a port of the original game. Unfortunately, the transition again falls short of the original, with even worse graphics and a low frame rate. While people unfamiliar with the original might enjoy playing this mode, gamers looking to Centipede for an authentic, arcade-perfect experience will be sorely disappointed.', ""What developers don't realize is that nostalgic gamers who still play classic arcade games play them because they enjoy the experience of playing with vector graphics with a simple control scheme and substandard sound. It's truly difficult to compare games of yesterday with games of today, as almost everything has changed technologically. It feels as if Centipede is trying so hard to recapture the magic of the original, by latching onto itself to extinct gameplay, that it pulls what could have been a great 3D shooter into the hollow of mediocrity. --Ben Stahl <br />--<i>Copyright 1999 GameSpot Inc.

770,Vigilante 8: 2nd Offense,"[""Combine <i>Mad Max</i>'s anarchic road rules, <i>Smokey and the Bandit</i>'s classic cat-and-mouse chases, a royal salute to the <i>Dukes of Hazzard</i>'s car aerobatics, and you've got yourself the components for one entertaining auto combat game. The original <i>Vigilante 8</i> was a critical success and now, after some under-the-hood tweaks, <i>Vigilante 8: Second Offense</i> rolls off the line with upgraded graphics and effects, and a load of new weapons, power-ups, and levels."", ""Defeated by the vigilantes back in the '70s, the desert-dwelling Coyote gang is leaping into leader Slick Clyde's time machine to rewrite the past. And, naturally, they're taking an arsenal of futuristic weapons and surprises with them."", ""Players cruise 12 different locations around the country in 18 '70s-era vehicles (and one futuristic hovercraft), each with a unique set of weapons and defenses. The single-player mode offers adventurous mini-missions that, inevitably, end up with all sorts of stuff blowing up. The multiplayer mode invites up to four players to join in on a free-for-all destruction derby."", ""The original Vigilante 8 was perhaps the one car combat game last year that offered a truly fresh perspective on the genre. This time around, with Second Offense, the team at Luxoflux isn't content to merely add a few cars, throw together a few more levels, and ship a quick and dirty sequel. Instead, there are some major gameplay changes afoot in this sequel. The graphics have also been overhauled, adding cool new touches like specular highlights. But it all still feels like a very solid car combat game, just like the original V8."", 'Vigilante 8 strapped you into one of twelve different cars, as you played as a member of the heroic Vigilantes, the villainous Coyotes, or the neutral Drifters in a \'70s version of The Road Warrior. According to producer Murali Tegulapalle of Activision, Second Offense is ""still going to be a vehicular combat game, and we\'re still going to have some key characters and \'70s overtones from the original to keep it within the Vigilante universe. However, we\'ll also be adding new features, vehicles, characters, and so on, to take Vigilante 8 to the next level.""', 'The game takes on a futuristic play mechanic with the addition of Back To the Future-like hovering cars, which allows you fly to a certain extent. The storyline has a time travel element to it, and in fact, this game takes place before the first Vigilante 8. The Coyotes have travelled back in time in the hopes of defeating the Vigilantes before their big conflict even gets off the ground.', 'Not just a rehash of the original, the second installment should be a whole new experience. Running on a rebuilt and modified version of the original engine, Second Offense brings new cameras, new power-ups, new weapons, and most, importantly, new vehicles and characters. There will be more new characters than old, with favorites from the original game returning as unlockable characters. As in the original, every character will have his own vehicle, mission objective, gang affiliation, stats, and special weapon. Along with the hoverpods, you can also pick up power-ups that turn your wheels into water-friendly rotors or snow treads.', ""Graphically, the game has improvements over its predecessor with new effects like fog, brake lights, exhaust, water effects, and bigger, more-impressive explosions. On the Dreamcast, this game looks particularly gorgeous. There's still a bit of pop-up in the current beta version, but that will surely be improved before the game's release. In the sound department, Second Offense offers more of the '70s-inspired funk grooves that rocked the original, as well as refined and brand-new sound effects."", 'One large improvement over the original will be a two-player version of the original\'s quest mode, with broader and more involving objectives. ""In addition to one- and two-player quests,"" says Tegulapalle, ""we\'ll also have several variants on the arcade mode, such as brawl, desperado, and team."" With plenty of play options, Second Offense promises even more car crunching, machine gunning, high-speed car combat than that of its predecessor. --Staff <br />--<i>Copyright 1999 GameSpot Inc.

772,Glover,"[""Glover, in concept, is a novel approach to the often-trite realm of the platform game. The thoughtful marriage of puzzle elements with action-oriented gameplay is a pleasant step away from the usual, twitchy platform fare. On the PlayStation platform, though, the concept is only marginally realized, due to the title's mediocre presentation. Perhaps the port from the N64 was too much for the little guy to bear.  The narrative unfolds as follows: In a faraway land, a wizard is charged with the task of guarding his kingdom's power source, a set of magical crystals. This wizard dabbles in alchemy, and one fateful day, an experiment goes awry: Doodling with the wrong alchemical components has caused what he was brewing to explode, literally knocking his gloves off, one flying out the window, the other falling into the cauldron. Exposure to this brew, presumably, granted his accessories sentience, and, conveniently enough, for the purpose of storytelling, one became good, the other evil. Unfortunately, the mishap scattered the crystals in the wizard's charge all across the kingdom and turned the poor chap to stone. Luckily, Glover, the good glove, was able to weave a spell that turned the crystals into red bouncy balls before they fell to the ground and shattered, along with the hope and livelihood of the kingdom. While the narrative is definitely endearing, the port wasn't kind, and, unfortunately, it has a rough bearing on the gameplay.  You play as Glover, and your quest is to retrieve these crystals before Cross-Stitch, your evil twin, gets his mitts on them. The game is laid out in a series of six worlds, each containing five levels. While the objective of each world (defeat boss; recover crystal) doesn't stray too much from the platform convention, the actions required to solve each world definitely take on an unconventional tone. In order to complete each level successfully, Glover must scoot the ball (which is really a crystal) toward the end of each stage. Blocking him is a series of obstacles, including enemies (which are, sadly, much of a nonpresence in that they're insanely simple to avoid) and puzzles. The emphasis is definitely on the latter aspect, and this is where Glover shines; see, the ball Glover carries can be transmuted into a number of different forms: a bouncy rubber ball, a heavy bowling ball, a magnetic ball bearing, and a fragile crystal. Each form carries its own properties, letting Glover manage a certain terrain or solve a certain puzzle. Glover uses the rubber ball to walk on water, the bowling ball to walk underwater, etc. The physics model that is used grants each form very realistic properties, affecting how far it can be thrown or how high or frequently it bounces. Glover is armed with a variety of attacks, including the ball-swat, in which he swats the ball in one of its heavier forms toward the enemy, thus squashing the enemy, and the fist-drop, which is very similar to the token platform butt-drop, save that Glover actually assumes the form of a fist and pummels any creature unfortunate enough to be under him. When throwing (which is paramount to the completion of many of the game's puzzles) or swatting the ball, you're able to choose the ball's trajectory. This feature is inadequate ,usually allowing no more than four trajectories for the ball to follow, mainly corresponding to cardinal directions. During certain boss battles, it becomes unnecessarily difficult to aim the ball in the enemy's general direction, let alone fight efficiently.  The game's presentation, however, is the factor that most largely damages Glover. While the environments look more or less adequate, the character models are severely blurry and underdetailed, making the whole thing seem less than polished. Due to the ubiquitous low-res elements, the entire game appears rather bland and sedate. This fact, unfortunately, brings the otherwise thoughtful and expressive environments down. The music and sounds are venomously tinny and have a certain disturbingly pervasive quality to them; they'll creep into your brain, and you will dream about them for nights to come. The entire presentation makes you feel as if you're playing half a game, rather than a solid, deep full game.  Perhaps Glover 2 (which is being developed for the N64 and the PlayStation) will be something to get a bit more excited about. Glover, despite its interesting play mechanics, seems to have lost its soul in the port from the N64. Very unfortunate. With the host of platformers available for the PlayStation, finding an adequate substitute shouldn't prove too difficult.<i>--Miguel Lopez</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

773,The Next Tetris,"[""It seems as if the world's fascination with the Russian-created puzzle game <I>Tetris</I> will never end. Hasbro Interactive and Atari have introduced yet another challenging version of the shape- shifting classic <I>Tetris</I>. The new format follows rules similar to the classic game. However, there are now new objects (sticky blocks and cascades) to contend with. The sticky blocks add a clever twist to the action, since they connect themselves to other pieces of the same color when placed next to one another. These resulting sticky blocks are bigger and less mobile than regular blocks. As in the original <I>Tetris</I>, clearing a line of blocks will often result in a chain reaction that can cause other blocks to fall. At this point, the game can get quite frantic since these blocks often end up creating matches that trigger more chain reactions. It's a dizzying experience--but that's the charm of the game."", 'Players can choose from marathon mode (a single-player sequential game), two-player competition, or puzzle-style levels that require you to clear prepositioned blocks in a certain amount of time. The new elements make this updated game more challenging than the original, yet <I>The Next Tetris</I> retains all the charm of the game that started it all. Even diehard <I>Tetris</I> fans will have a difficult time finding fault with this game, since it includes a faithful reproduction of the original version as well. <i>--Carrie Bell</i>', '<b>Pros:</b> <ul> <li>Utilizes dual shock analog controller</li> <li>Sticky blocks add new dimension to gameplay</li> </ul> <b>Cons:</b> <ul> <li>More expensive than the original title</li> </ul>', 'Think you\'ve mastered the game of Tetris? Know how to defeat all your friends? Know exactly where each block should go the second it touches the screen? Well, forget all that and throw it out the window. The Next Tetris is here, and you\'re going to have to unlearn everything you know. This is the game\'s most appealing feature, but also its biggest flaw. <P>Unlike previous incarnations of the Tetris brand, there is a definite end to each stage in The Next Tetris. The game places blocks on your screen at the start of the match and it\'s your objective to clear them off. This held my attention at first, but after a few minutes I was simply aching to go back to Tetris on the Game Boy Color - it just didn\'t feel right to only clear boards. Tetris has always been about seeing how long you can last. <P>Then I discovered how to make use of the new multicolored Next Tetris blocks. Now this was a game. <P>This is where you\'ll have a whole new game of Tetris to master - I played the game every single night for about a week, and I still didn\'t come close to figuring out exactly how to place each block. But the block placements I did come to understand really left me with a feeling of accomplishment. So it\'s not the old-style Tetris we\'ve known over the years, but The Next Tetris manages to become a fun game in its own right. Kudos to Blue Planet Software for coming up with this new spice for the Tetris formula. <P>Where The Next Tetris - and basically any Tetris, for that matter - really excels is in its two-player game. The ""first one to clear the blocks wins"" formula makes for great rivalry and is quite addicting. But here\'s where I noticed how one really has to relearn Tetris strategies. Instead of attempting to make sure there are no gaps in your lining of blocks (as you\'ve been trained to do from past Tetris games), in the Next Tetris it\'s OK to have gaps - often, they cause big chain reactions when blocks fall. Also, performing a Tetris (clearing four blocks at one time), the biggest accomplishment in past Tetris versus modes, does nothing more than shake your opponent\'s screen in this version. These new features definitely take some getting used to. <P>Tetris has never been about advanced graphics, so when I say that The Next Tetris\' graphics look pretty generic it should come as no surprise. There\'s nothing wrong with how the game looks, but there\'s nothing really new or extraordinary to be found here. The blocks, which are polygonal so they can stretch and shake, are quite cool though. Aurally, the game does the job as well. The soundtrack is mostly upbeat techno that includes several remixes of past Tetris anthems. My only gripe is that I wish there were more tracks. I\'m not sick of the six or so tunes yet, but give me a few more weeks of playing and I\'ll surely start switching over to my CD player for audio. <P>I\'d recommend this game to anyone looking for a new Tetris fix - it\'s definitely different enough from the other versions to warrant a purchase. Once you discover the beauty of The Next Tetris\' new block system, you\'ll immediately become hooked. But again, be warned - this is not the old-school Tetris you\'ve gotten used to over the years. I suppose many people will be glad to hear that, though... It\'s time for something new. --Sam Kennedy <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

775,Scrabble,"['Hasbro Interactive has been bringing board games and Atari titles to the PlayStation for a couple of years now, and with a library in both categories that is interminably deep, it\'s no surprise that another one has just launched from the gate. Enter Scrabble, the game you used to play on your kitchen table; it\'s now on your TV screen, and that\'s probably telling enough. Perhaps more versatile than the board game itself, this version has three modes of play: normal, solitaire, and tournament.  In the normal mode, you play against another human or a computer opponent in a single match. If you select the computer player, you\'ll be able to select its intelligence level. These levels include novice, beginner, intermediate, advanced, expert, champion, master, and grand master. The solitaire mode is pretty self-explanatory: You play a round against yourself, aiming to earn as many points as possible. The tournament mode is a single-player game in which you play your way through the ranks of computer opponents - beginning with the dimmest and working your way up to the grand masters in an attempt to become the Scrabble champ yourself. And it\'s not too tough. One of the only downsides is that you can\'t manipulate the CPU into believing some stupid word you heard once in a foreign film you didn\'t understand and misspelled wrong in the first place is actually a word you should receive points for. The interface is 2D, allowing you all the traditional board-game Scrabble functions, from rearranging your letters on the rack before placing them on the ""board"" to trading in the sour letters at the cost of a turn. And you can\'t keep your pals from cheating in two-player mode as any idiot can figure out, because you\'re looking at the same screen. But ""Turn around before I kick you out of my house"" is one way to deal with it. The Scrabble hard sell? It does the math for you. The worst thing? You can\'t cheat by stowing illicit tiles in your lap.  Scrabble on the PlayStation appears to be exactly what you expect from Scrabble at your mom\'s house - minus the little wooden letters that look like bouillon cubes. It\'s slow, there aren\'t any power-ups, no one jumps out of the ceiling to shoot you in midturn, and you can\'t apply stealth in any way whatsoever. If you\'re the card playing, board-game digging type, this\'ll probably be right up your alley - or you could buy one of those jazzy lazy-Susan Scrabble boards for about the same price. But don\'t go into it expecting Scrabble on the PlayStation to be anything but Scrabble with a cathode-ray glow.<i>--Lauren Fielder</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

776,Heavy Gear 2 - PC,"['Your unit is to be transported to the planet Caprice, the base of the enemy. Practice espionage and gain intelligence on weaponry and counter tactics. You are one of the finest warriors in history and your Gear equipment echoes that fact. Prove your bravery as you advance behind enemy lines to prevent future extraplanetary invasions of Terra Nova.', ""So what if it lost FASA's Battletech license. That didn't stop Activision from turning out another MechWarrior game, albeit disguised under a new brand name. Heavy Gear, based on Dream Pod 9's rival anime-inspired giant robot pen-and-paper RPG, looks, sounds, and plays much like Activision's popular MechWarrior games, putting you in command of a powerful mobile suit loaded with devastating weapons and thick armor plating. Heavy Gear should have been an all-new game; Gears are much smaller than Mechs, standing a mere four meters in height on the average. They're supposed to be fast and agile, limited only by the flexibility and speed of their human pilots. But in Activision's game, you become a slave to the war machine you thought was yours to command, much how you might have felt in MechWarrior 2. <P> Heavy Gear looks sharp at first glance. Each Gear is rendered in careful detail and textured in dark camouflage, lending these massive mobile suits a look even better than their distant BattleMech cousins. Also gone is the flat, lifeless terrain of MechWarrior 2, replaced this time with rolling hills and plenty of boulders, cacti, and other such obstacles that can be used as cover in the heat of battle. At the same time, 3D accelerator owners can take advantage of enhanced frame rates and special effects including flowing clouds, lighting, and transparent shadows. But with or without a 3D accelerator, you'll certainly appreciate the unobtrusive green heads-up display, which readily displays your status and weapons loadout while outlining your target in color-coded wire frame to show how much damage he's sustained, and where. <P> Unfortunately, further investigation yields that the graphics could have fared considerably better. For one thing, in spite of the varied topography, a Gear always looks like it's walking straight ahead - even as it scales a near-vertical hillside. This effect is more disorienting than, say, the pixelated, bland-looking explosions that further detract from the game's aesthetic value. Moreover, the effects of your Gear's various weapon systems look plain and, at best, leave much to the imagination. <P> Thankfully, Heavy Gear's audio doesn't suffer the same faults as its visuals. From the bass-heavy stomping of your Gear's legs as it rushes into battle to the metal-on-metal clank of your rifle shots tearing into the enemy, you'll get a good feel for the combat through Heavy Gear's sound. All the while, a stirring, percussion-heavy synth-orchestral soundtrack adds that epic feel to each and every battle. But strangely enough, this soundtrack sounds rather like the scores that added so much atmosphere to MechWarrior 2 and Mercenaries. This big nod to Activision's previous future simulators turns out to be only the first of many. <P> For all intents and purposes, Heavy Gear plays just like MechWarrior 2. Mech veterans will have an easy time making the switch over to Gears, what with no longer having to worry about overheating or any such complications. Otherwise, even though Gears are supposed to be many times more maneuverable than Mechs, Heavy Gear feels almost as lethargic as did the Mech games at their worst. Other opportunities to capitalize on the smaller, faster humanoid Gear design were likewise passed up. A Gear can only carry a single handheld gun while the other arm dangles uselessly at its side; close-range melee weapons, which appear in the pen-and-paper RPG, are conspicuously absent. Gears can crouch, but they need to come to a dead halt first, which is a lot more trouble than it's worth most of the time. Likewise, Gears can sidestep, but this is only a trivial addition considering they can twist 180 degrees at the torso. Other elements of gameplay fare better; for instance, you can pick up spare weapons from the battlefield should yours run out of ammo. Each Gear has wheels, letting you move quickly from point to point or escape from battle in a pinch. Gears also have their own AI, which means you learn enhanced abilities as you progress through the game. A powerful blow will knock a Gear clean off its feet, leaving it vulnerable until it manages to clamber back to a standing position. <P> Heavy Gear offers two well-designed solo play modes, the first being a linear story composed of nearly three dozen missions. The story unfolds through beautifully rendered cutscenes in between missions and over radio communication during the missions themselves. The missions continue to surprise and contain enough variety to hold interest through to the story's conclusion. Throughout these missions, the computer-controlled opponents will have you outnumbered - but probably not outclassed. The AI has a bad habit of shooting straight at you rather than leading its shots, making torso-twist strafing runs unusually effective. And while the AI deserves a bit of praise for trying to use cover to its advantage, you'll be hard pressed to stifle a chuckle the first time you see an opposing Gear blow itself up by walking into a boulder. Nevertheless, the computer will provide a competent challenge if only because of its superior numbers, especially since you can't rely on your inept squad mates to get you out of a pinch. Even when you finish with the story mode, you'll find plenty to like in the less structured but equally enjoyable tour-of-duty game, which allows you to handpick your missions as you rise through the ranks on either side of a civil war. This mode offers a vast scope of the conflict as one side gradually takes the advantage over supplies, intelligence, and sheer numbers. But before you leap headlong into warfare, you'll want to run through the helpful training exercises, which will whip you into fighting shape within an hour or so. <P> After winning your virtual war, you'll probably want to try your skills against your friends. Fortunately, Heavy Gear comes equipped with Internet multiplayer support right out of the box. Unfortunately, Activision makes it little secret that Heavy Gear's Internet play option is in an unfinished beta form. Glitches and crashes abound both in the menu screen and during actual multiplayer gameplay, though you'll probably get a game going with a little perseverance. Promises of a patch don't change the fact that an important component of this product was allowed to ship in an incomplete form, no doubt to make the Christmas rush. At least Heavy Gear's solo play modes don't suffer from the same glaring hang-ups. <P> With the exception of its lacking originality, Heavy Gear contains all the elements of a successful game and is certainly the finest game of its kind in many months. Of course, it's also the only game of its kind to be published in many months, which makes it a definite buy for those yearning for more giant robots since last year's Mercenaries. Its similarities to MechWarrior 2 and Mercenaries ensure that fans of those games will also enjoy Heavy Gear. At the same time, its similarities represent a missed opportunity to create an all-new product centered around a new kind of vehicle design. Instead, Heavy Gear feels very derivative right down to its soundtrack and ironic intro, with only a handful of new gameplay features on top of a superior story mode and the enjoyable tour of duty. Heavy Gear will keep most mech sim fans busy for a good while, much of which will be spent wondering why it didn't have the courage to break from its roots. <i>--Greg Kasavin</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

777,Worms Armageddon,"['Do you ever wonder what all of those worms squirming around subterranean  tunnels are scheming? We do, too. As it turns out, according to <i>Worms  Armageddon</i>, our wacky segmented friends have a stockpile of crazy weapons and  are waging a war big enough to turn the world into a heaping compost pile. Who  knew?', '<i>Worms Armageddon</i> brings the humorously addictive gameplay of the very  popular <i>Worms</i> series to the PlayStation for the first time. The strategy-based  gameplay is as unique as the premise. Commanding a team of worms, players wriggle  and shoot through 30 missions and 14 training levels. Players take turns moving a worm  warrior into position and then firing at the opposing team, using an arsenal of weapons  ranging from mines and kamikaze attacks to the more traditional exploding sheep attack  and banana bombs. Naturally, the commander who best combines strategic moves with  creative attacks wins the worm war.', ""Join the throngs of fans of this unique game series and you'll never look at a grinning,  gun-toting earthworm in the same way again. <i>--Eric Twelker</i>"", 'Do you ever wonder what worms do in their free time? The third chapter of the popular Worms series, Worms Armageddon, has you believe that instead of just hiding under rocks and floating down storm drains, worms are actually ruthless militant creatures with boyish British accents that constantly fight each other. This simple, somewhat innocent premise sets the stage for an excellent turn-based strategy game, as Worms Armageddon is not only the best Worms game, it\'s also an incredible multiplayer experience. The concept is pretty simple: You control a team of well-armed worms, and your objective is to kill the other worms any way you can. You do this on a 2D plane that\'s usually a series of odd platforms and objects precariously placed over deadly water. (Worms can\'t swim.) The combat itself takes place in a series of timed turn-based rounds that seamlessly flow into each other. Each of your worms shares a collective arsenal from which you can choose all sorts of weapons - from the devastatingly serious to the laughably wacky. From there, you switch to a manual aiming and firing scheme used to unleash your weapon of choice at the worm you\'re targeting. This leads to all sorts of havoc, as combat tends to lend itself to poorly aimed explosives and the fun effects they cause. The worms and everything around them have a distinctly animated look to them. Big eyes and oddly shaped household items show the comic-strip influence of the graphics, and combined with the simple 2D layout, it makes Worms Armageddon something of a throwback to the old school. The detail is simple but effective, and it helps support the humorous themes running through the game\'s elements. Switching to more offbeat weapons will generally change your character\'s appearance - a worm will don a headband before administering a dragon-punch, and a worm armed with a battle-ax is also outfitted with a Viking helmet. Explosions and animations are simple - worms shuffle along when you\'re moving them, and explosives blow up within a pretty obvious radius. Still, more detail to some animations, such as the shotgun fire, could have provided Worms with a bit more graphical prowess and, in turn, could have helped sort out exactly where the blast hit (or missed). Apparently, all worms come from Europe somewhere and have a definite lack of testosterone in their voices. Squeaky, high-pitched speech fills the game with colorful comments from your worm army as you play. If a live grenade is tossed next to you, your worm will scream, ""Run for it."" If it completely misses, your worm will ask, ""What was that?"" This effect is only mildly cute and strictly tiptoes the fine line of being annoying. Other sound effects - such as explosions, bouncing grenades, and submachine gun fire - are done well and lend a bit of realism to an otherwise unrealistic experience. Mild, almost unnoticeable music plays in the background and helps you  focus on the task at hand. The only particularly bad thing about the audio is the German beer commercial-like Euro-dance that pulses over the title screen. Still, a few button presses, and this is all but forgotten. It\'s the weapons in this game that make it really fun. Every combat game may have grenades and shotguns, but not a whole lot of them have pneumatic drills, ninja ropes, supersheep, and sticks of dynamite. This huge assortment of instruments used to deal out the pain keeps things fairly fresh and funny, as each weapon has its own silly effect. Still, there are some weapons that are just too powerful, and once you\'ve mastered them, they have a countereffect on the gameplay. On top of that, instead of switching off between worms, the turn system switches off between teams - meaning a team with a single worm will get four turns before four worm on one team goes once. This makes it unduly difficult to kill the last worm on a team, as he easily gets a tactical advantage with his multiple turns. It\'s terribly frustrating to be killed before you can even get a shot off. Multiplayer is where this game is at. You can go at it with up to three friends, and you don\'t even need a multitap. The turned-based combat makes controller-passing feasible, and a generous time limit lets even the most thorough planners establish exactly what they want to do before they make their move. The easy-to-pick-up gameplay makes this a great party game, and the ensuing hilarity from the calamity that is bound to happen makes this a game everyone can laugh at. Unfortunately, the single-player game just isn\'t as good. The computer still has eagle-eye accuracy, and down to its last worm it is capable of factoring in wind, trajectory, and ricochet, so you can place that one deadly bazooka shell halfway across a level, through a series of ledges, and right on top of your worm. This makes it all the more frustrating to play against the computer, as it seems to almost cheat. Still, the AI is capable of doing some pretty lame things itself, such as bouncing a grenade back to its sender or shooting the floor out from under itself. But the AI definitely favors certain weapons - the bazooka, grenades, shotgun, and mines are all high on the AI\'s list of weapons of choice, while the dragon punch, the battle-ax, or the Uzi are almost never wielded by the computer-controlled worms. Also, the computer tends to take an extremely long time plotting exactly how it\'s going to attack your troops, and, as such, you spend a lot of the single-player game just waiting for a worm to make its move.  Worms Armageddon is designed so you can play with other people, and the single-player match is really no substitute. If you\'ve got plenty of friends who spend their time lounging around your place, definitely pick this one up for some rewarding gameplay and good laughs. Although the game has its weak points, the solid gameplay and simple control make this game a must-have for anyone who likes to play games with other humans.<i>--Ben Stahl</i>--<i>Copyright  1998 GameSpot Inc.

780,Pong: The Next Level,"['In a world where no classic game is safe from being converted into a current-day remake, the game that started it all has finally had its number called. A whole new generation now has the opportunity to fall in love with the new Pong - the Pong of a new millennium - on the PlayStation console. But before you dust off your paddles and call all your friends over, you may want to ponder this - was Pong really all that fun, or was it just that there were no other video games? The basic concept of Pong hasn\'t changed - keep the ball from entering the goal by deflecting it with the paddle. But the latest edition of Pong at least keeps things slightly interesting by introducing several new game elements, many of which have their own levels. Sometimes you\'ll have sheep and penguins on the board with you; other times, huge fans will blow your ball to and fro, and you\'ll have to bounce a colored ball into its place. The new version of Pong also introduces a power-up system. You can introduce computer controlled blockers, perform super-shots, and even grab the ball itself (your paddle hugs around it). But still, the game is pretty much the same as it was 26 years ago. The graphics are simple and nice. There seems to be some weird theme running through the game that your paddle is alive, as it jumps around and acts generally pleased when you beat a level. Aside from that, the animation is fairly generic. The things that you run into while playing behave as they should - sheep hop about, penguins waddle, and frogs jump. There are some fairly creative level designs here, like the log-jammer level, which has logs that push the ball in certain directions, or the chicken-egg level, where a rack of chickens lay various colored eggs for you to sort. These are a nice touch and obviously more welcome than the simple black-and-white graphics of the original. While the music in the game is fairly good, the sound effects are really bothersome. While each level is loading, your paddle will giggle and make all other sorts of weird noises, which you\'ll likely find as disturbing as I did. Maybe it\'s just the pitch at which the paddle ""speaks,"" but after one or two levels, I cringed every time I heard it. Unfortunately, the control really isn\'t up to par. The digital control is way too touchy, and the analog control seems to be too loose. There\'s nothing more frustrating than giving up a point simply because the control is so unresponsive. Also, the computer paddles are really good, especially in the games where there\'s a paddle directly in front of yours. This forces you to exploit weaknesses in the AI - such as bouncing a shot off the wall - and it makes you feel as if you\'re only winning because the computer is dumb. Another thing you\'ll notice is that the computer will line itself up directly in front of your paddle after a point is scored, but when it serves, it immediately shoots the ball out, without giving you a chance to maneuver in front of it. This will make you almost dread the four-paddle games, as they\'re fairly one-sided. Looking for a revolutionary, new, exciting game? Perhaps you should look elsewhere, because when it all boils down, this game is still Pong. Sure, there are new levels, and the game has been changed quite a bit, but you\'re still moving a stupid paddle up and down a playing field and hitting a ball. Few people are likely to get a thrill out of playing the original Pong anymore, and, unfortunately, the Pong of the new generation doesn\'t do much better.<i>--Ben Stahl</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

781,Risk,"[""You remember Risk, that classic board game where contestants vie for global  domination through military strategy? It's been taken off the kitchen table and ported into  your PlayStation, where you can hone your tactics against computer opponents or  challenge up to three of your closest enemies."", ""The classic Risk level shows the game as you remember it. The easy-to-use interface will  quickly whisk you into the heat of war. Those interested in more challenging gameplay  should try the ultimate Risk level, which features weather variables, geographic  obstacles, and fortifications. As a general, you'll create alliances with other players, take  their armies captive, set booby traps, and employ super troops that fight harder and live  longer."", ""No matter your struggle--classic or ultimate--<I>Risk</I> offers you the unique  opportunity of crushing your opponents while taking over the world. And though you  can't knock all the game pieces over in a frustrated rage if you lose... you can hit the reset  button. <I>--Eric Twelker</I>"", 'Hasbro Interactive has successfully ""ported"" one of the oldest and most popular turn-based strategy games to the PlayStation. This one has all the elements of the board game down: the cards, the geographically dubious map, even onscreen dice that roll with a thunderous clamor. Plus you can mix real opponents with CPU ones, and there are lots of odd new options, including Blind Risk and Ultimate Risk, which replace  the ease and speed of Classic Risk with some rudimentary realism and strategic considerations. In fact, the only thing missing is the little plastic roman numerals. <P>For the uninitiated, the game of Risk may seem a little odd. Idiosyncrasies abound. At the beginning of the game, each opponent\'s armies are distributed randomly throughout the world - though a manual battalion placement option is available. When you conquer territories you are awarded strange playing cards with cannons and horses on them that are redeemable for reinforcements. Last-surviving defending armies always win in a tied roll of the dice, making them fairly fearsome opponents when outnumbered. Plus there\'s the steamroller effect, by which a single country with enough reinforcements and a little luck can take over territory after territory in a single turn. As long as it doesn\'t run out of troops, it can keep going until it has taken over the entire world. In short, realism is out the window. And that\'s what makes it Risk. <P>Hasbro Interactive could have made the PlayStation version much more realistic. It could have included troop morale, food supplies, different types of units (there\'s only one), and so forth. Heck, it could\'ve thrown the old game out the window and slapped the license on a brand-spankin\'-new real-time strategy game with hyperrealism, and the N64 version could have used the Rumble Pak to simulate troop hunger. Thank God Hasbro didn\'t. Hasbro Interactive made the right call by leaving it simple, full of illogical rules that also happen to be really fun. Like the original, Risk for the PlayStation is straight-ahead, fast-paced, and easy to play right out of the box. <P>The game looks great too, with a simple interface, multiple map views at the touch of a button, and terrain that looks great onscreen, even if it doesn\'t affect play in any way. Video is kept to a minimum in the Classic Risk version of the game, only appearing when individual opponents are completely wiped out or the world is completely dominated. The only visual shortcoming is in the size of the main map\'s view. All actions, troop movements, and invasions occur while only roughly 20 percent of the world is visible. Sure, complete world maps are only a triangle button away, but you can\'t perform any actions while looking at them. It would be easier to make small-scale tactical decisions if the large-scale strategic concepts were always visible. The game also features impressive military music that perfectly sets the tone, a huge bashing sound whenever the dice are rolled, and a number of other sound effects whose tasteful brevity enhances the feel of the game without detracting from the mood of the original. <P>A number of options round out the game. Up to four players plus up to four CPU opponents may play at once. AI may be set from easy to hard, with a dramatic effect on gameplay. Blind Risk makes it impossible to see into enemy territory for troop counts. Ultimate Risk is an entirely different game and makes a stab at realistic turn-based strategy. Featuring random turn order, dramatic weather effects, and choice of combat formation, the game offers generals to wield, forts and capitals to erect, and a much more realistic set of attack routing options that deflate the strategic importance of certain territories. In Classic Risk, there are only three ways in to the Americas, making those three territories the linchpin of strategy in the Western Hemisphere. In Ultimate Risk, piling all your armies in a few places doesn\'t make you safe. While all this is much more realistic, the new options bog down the speed of the original. Most folks looking for this level of strategy should probably cut to the chase and pick up Command & Conquer instead. <P>Hasbro Interactive has provided a near-perfect translation from the board game to the PlayStation. It has managed to preserve the style of play perfectly, without adding too many annoying new features to distract from Risk\'s sublime simplicity and speed. You won\'t lose the little plastic pieces, and your dog won\'t eat the cards. Plus, next time you feel like sweeping across Europe, but are worried that it\'s a little premature, you can save your game before you ""risk"" it. Perhaps they should have called the PlayStation version ""Less Risk."" --Josh Smith <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Using a highly realistic tank model, you'll see action across North Africa, Italy, and Normandy as you take on historically accurate missions. Challenges include scouting, protecting truck convoys, sealing off villages, and the search-and-rescue of missing units."", '1998 was to be the year that tank simulation fans would have their long-standing wish fulfilled for a realistic World War II tank sim. No fewer than three such games were scheduled for release: Interactive Magic\'s iPanzer \'44, SSI\'s Panzer Commander, and Psygnosis\' Panzer Elite. iPanzer and Panzer Commander were released on schedule, and SSI\'s game was generally considered the better of the two. However, Psygnosis elected to hold on to Panzer Elite for another year of development by German developer Wings Simulations. It would appear that the extra time paid off, because Panzer Elite is without a doubt the most realistic 1940s tank sim yet released. Even so, the game contains numerous bugs out of the box, requires a fast system, and has a steep learning curve. In addition, the campaigns covering battles between the Americans and Germans in North Africa, Sicily, Italy, and Normandy limit the game\'s scope. <P>It\'s inevitable that comparisons will be made between Panzer Elite and SSI\'s Panzer Commander. The most glaring omission from SSI\'s game was infantry, but Wings did not make the same mistake with Panzer Elite. Although the bitmapped infantry units won\'t wow you, driving your tank platoon into a town occupied by enemy infantry is a sure recipe for disaster - as it should be. American infantry armed with bazookas and German infantry armed with panzerfaust and panzerschreck antitank weapons will move about in close terrain and pick off your vehicles one by one. Therefore, making use of combined arms (armor, infantry, and artillery) is a necessity. <P>Panzer Commander featured air and artillery support, but you had no control over it. Panzer Elite lets you put artillery and air strikes where you need them, when you need them. The only problem with Panzer Elite\'s treatment of artillery is that it seems unrealistically deadly as a tank killer and is perhaps more lethal than it should be against infantry under cover. <P>Panzer Commander\'s terrain was good, but Panzer Elite\'s terrain is better. The dips and folds in the ground that can provide armor with cover and concealment, even in relatively flat desert terrain, are present in both games. What sets Panzer Elite apart is the close terrain. Forests are made up of individual trees and bushes. Towns consist of walls, fences, ruins, and buildings that can be smashed through by your tanks. <P>Panzer Elite also deserves credit for having better artificial intelligence that not only makes enemy units fight smarter, but also helps the members of your tank platoon stay near your command tank. This lets them make a real contribution in battle. In too many Panzer Commander scenarios, you sometimes felt as if it was your tank against the world because your platoonmates either got stuck on an obstacle or were quickly destroyed. Panzer Elite provides an innovative feature that lets you maneuver your tanks individually to locations you select. However, this doesn\'t always work as it should. Sometimes your tanks will end up in positions far different than you intended or will take convoluted routes that unnecessarily expose them to danger. It\'s a great idea that\'s flawed in execution. <P>The game\'s interface relies heavily on a mind-boggling array of keyboard commands. The ""mouse tank"" feature, an onscreen line diagram showing your tank\'s heading and the relative position of the turret and hull, lets you give basic commands through a pop-up menu to members of your tank platoon, either individually or as a group. You can also use the pop-up menu to jump to different crew positions, such as the loader, gunner, driver, radio operator/hull machine gunner, and commander. However, you\'ll soon discover there are many other useful commands that aren\'t displayed on the menu. Plus, in the heat of battle, the keyboard commands can be issued far more quickly. -- <i>Patrick C. Miller</i> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Each bowler has a little video clip (similar to THQ's wrestling game, WCW Nitro) that proclaims how much of a badass he is. These clips provide the most hilarious gaming moments in recent memory. Each video is chock-full of bad reads, funny-looking bowler types, and poorly conveyed braggadocio. <P> There are a few different gameplay modes to choose from. Exhibition games get you going quickly, with no strings attached. Just pick a bowler and get on with it. Other modes include the skins game, the tournament, career mode, and cosmic bowling, which turns the lanes into a discotheque. The lane is realistically oiled, which forces you to move around the lane and vary your rolls as conditions change, but this doesn't really make the game terribly hard. Expect to bowl around 150 within your first two games. <P> The graphics are much more than you'd expect from a bowling game. There are tons of different camera angles, which are automatically selected on each roll of the ball. The players look like their real-life counterparts and are fairly well animated.

Does THQ's foray into the world of billiards make the shot, or does it scratch on the break? A little of both."", ""The first thing you notice about Ultimate 8 Ball is its realism. From the balls to the halls to the way your 3D opponents complacently chalk up, it's all there. Watching the complex gyroscopic pattern of the number on a ball as it spins to a stop is pretty convincing. While the sound is good, offering the satisfying crunch of a break and the warm, woody resonance of the felt on a bank shot, there really isn't much going on - certainly no more than you'd expect from a game of pool. The theme music for each of the game's 15 distinct halls lends everything from backwoods boogie to futuristic techno to enhance the mood or dampen it, depending on your taste."", ""Most importantly, the physics are highly realistic. Fine-tuning allows for minute variance in cue stick angle, butt angle, English, and stick speed, all with clockwork accuracy. Of course, this is a simulation, and that level of detail doesn't come without a price. In the real world, you could adjust these parameters simultaneously, in an instant. When you break a shot out into its multiple variables, as you would need to in any simulation, some time is involved and some interface issues arise as you adjust each one."", ""The gamepad or keyboard controls are probably your best bet with Ultimate 8 Ball. Individual parameters are adjusted with the D-pad (or arrows if using a keyboard), while the parameter itself is selected by holding its designated key. The default shot-tweaking speed is incredibly fast, so it's impossible to adjust most parameters without also holding the fine-tuning button, making each adjustment essentially a three-button operation. Unfortunately, when you are lining up your actual shot (where you want the cue ball to go), control is extremely sluggish - it takes forever to rotate the entire table 360-degrees. Though you can switch to an overhead view to speed up the process of finding your shot, there's no way to speed the actual rotation. This makes using a keyboard or gamepad quite frustrating."", ""The mouse doesn't have this problem, as its analog nature lets you rotate your shot 360-degrees in an instant. The rest of the mouse interface is more unwieldy, though. Mouse control is accomplished using an awkward system of clicking and holding icons that live at the bottom of the screen (representing the various control parameters) while using the mouse to move an independent cursor on the ball. It's disorienting and feels less natural than the gamepad's more intuitive control. With any controller, you're stuck holding down the fine-tuning key if you want anything that approximates accuracy. Though the mouse does allow for analog control of cue stick speed when it's time to shoot, it's not worth the hassle of grappling with all those icons."", 'The game has its own strange logic when it comes to its many options. Many of them are earned rather than given. Of the 16 opponents and ten environments, only four of each are available initially. You have to beat the weaker opponents in hustle mode to unlock the real sharks. Winning will also unlock hexagonal tables, tables with dog legs, and more. Fourteen different pool variations are there right from the start though, including eight ball, nine ball, and straight pool, plus some weird ones like tenpin, where each rack of balls is scored like a single frame of bowling.', ""Any pool game worth its felt is going to have some instructional component. Ultimate 8 Ball has a solid one, rendered using the game's own graphics engine rather than pawning it off to FMV. The tutorial offers a linear series of shots, which can be played in any sequence. Shots range from the basics to some real geometrical mind benders. Here the game's interface works well. For each shot you're given a choice of reading a description, watching a 3D-rendered instructor take the shot, or taking the shot yourself. You may do any of these as many times as you like. Gradually, concepts like English, positional cutting, and draw shots are introduced. The only real drawback to the tutorial is that, when watching the instructor shoot, everything happens so fast that it's difficult to absorb the interplay of angles, especially when dealing with complex shots involving multiple banks."", ""Ultimate 8 Ball offers most everything you could want in a pool game. Sure, Minnesota Fats doesn't host its tutorial, but there's something refreshing about keeping it all on the same engine. Load times are minimal. Its only real shortcoming is the one you may be familiar with from any game requiring you to control complex three-dimensional geometry in the two-dimensional world of the computer monitor. Unless someone develops an actual cue stick controller peripheral, pool control is going to remain a little dicey. <i>--Josh Smith</i> <br />--<i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

788,Monopoly,"['PlayStation ~ Monopoly', 'How many times have you sat with your family after Thanksgiving dinner, digesting turkey over your hotels on Boardwalk and Park Place, thinking, ""If only there were a PlayStation version of Monopoly, I could play by myself and at the end of the four hours, the AI wouldn\'t be nearly as drunk as Uncle Jim?"" Okay, unless you\'re a true Monopoly fanatic (if there is such a thing), probably never. Nonetheless, Hasbro Interactive has ported the ancient game of ruthless real-estate wheeling-and-dealing from the board game world to the PlayStation. The result is successful as a novelty, though it poses little threat to bankrupt the board-game industry. <P>Anyone not already familiar with the original Parker Brothers game will probably not bother with the PlayStation version. Nonetheless, the gist of the game is as follows: roll the dice and circle the board, buying or trading properties, building houses and hotels, and charging rent when your opponents land on them, in an attempt to bankrupt them. The more expensive a property is to buy and to build on, the more rent you can charge (or be charged) for landing on it. Oddly, players are also trying to stay out of jail (for crimes unknown). Once there, they attempt to get out without paying their bail. It works just the same on the PlayStation. <P>Remember handling all those little, plastic roman numerals in Risk? As with so many classic board games, much of the pleasure in playing Monopoly is derived from the nostalgic familiarity of the game\'s physical components. Designers Gremlin Interactive imbued the PlayStation version with near-perfect simulations of those elements. From the look of the board itself; to the thimbles, top hats, and statues used as pieces; to the deeds\' precise color and typeface, the utmost care has been taken to preserve the game\'s familiar image. <P>Unfortunately, the designers have omitted much critical information from the player\'s immediate view. For instance, you see neither your nor your opponents\' properties unless you enter a special Trading Screen. As a result, you never know which numbers you must roll to avoid landing on enemy turf. In any game involving dice, half the fun is in trying to will the dice to land on the numbers you want, and the lack of an immediate visual reference puts a real crimp in any such telekinesis. It also severely reduces the potential for gloating over one\'s affluence, as the extremes of pride and avarice that make Monopoly worth playing are sadly exiled to the Trading Screen. <P>Many important dealings go on in the game without adequate mention, let alone the fanfare they really deserve. When houses go up, they just appear onscreen. When AI players are low on cash and forced to sell back houses or mortgage properties, all that appears onscreen is the anticlimactic message ""AI Player has raised cash."" For such a crushing blow, this is hardly the kind of squirming required for true robber-baron-style fun. You can\'t even tell which properties are mortgaged as you move across the board - a critical piece of information since mortgaged properties are ""safe,"" that is, if you land on them, you aren\'t required to pay rent to the owner. That oversight, combined with no visual evidence of who owns which properties in the first place, removes any real sense of peril from the act of taking your turn. In the original version, by the end of the game, the board felt like a mine field of potential financial ruin. <P>The Gremlin Interactive designers managed to make the PlayStation version look and feel just like the original Monopoly.

789,Nations: WWII Fighter Command - PC,"['Relive battles fought during World War II. Forty-five missions feature air-to-air and air-to-ground fighting roles. Encounter virtual cockpits and realistic explosions as you experience combat and flight authenticity. Instant action, variable realism, and difficult settings are also included, making <i>Nations: WWII Fighter Command</i> as action packed as it is realistic.', 'There\'s been an explosion in the number of World War II flight sims in the past 12 months. After several quiet years, the prop-and-goggle crowd has been virtually snowed under by the likes of European Air War, Jane\'s WWII Fighters, Screamin\' Demons Over Europe, and more. Psygnosis appeared somewhat late in the game with Nations: WWII Fighter Command. Unfortunately, in a market filled with worthy competition, Nations doesn\'t have much hope of catching flight sim fans\' attention. The fact is that Nations\' flight model will instantly turn off those looking for a realistic flight sim, while the box description might turn away those looking for a more accessible game. <P>The game gives you the opportunity to fly a variety of British, American, and German aircraft and models another 22 aircraft flown only by the computer, including the Italian Macchis and Savoias. The flyable aircraft include the usual suspects, such as the Thunderbolt, Mustang, Spitfire, Focke-Wulf 190, and Messerschmitt 109 and 262. A couple of interesting inclusions are the Curtiss P-40 Warhawk and the Messerschmitt 163 ""Komet,"" a rocket-powered aircraft designed as a high-altitude bomber interceptor. In short, Nations has more than enough aircraft to keep you busy. <P>Nations requires a 3D accelerator of some sort and recommends an AGP card with at least 8MB of RAM. However, the game\'s 3D setup program did not let me specify my Nvidia TNT2. The only Nvidia chips supported by the program appeared to be the original TNT and the Riva 128. In fact, there was no Voodoo3 support listed, nor support for the Matrox G400. The game worked acceptably after I specified the TNT2 chip as a Riva 128, although there were several odd graphical glitches (especially after plane crashes) that didn\'t occur with a Voodoo2. It\'s strange to say the least that a game shipped in late 1999 wouldn\'t support the latest 3D chipsets. <P>Once you find an adequate video configuration, the game graphics turn out to be inconsistent. Some things, like the aircraft models, clouds, and lighting, look quite good. Other things like the terrain don\'t look as good, especially when viewed in flyby mode where the perspective changes rapidly and the screen is subject to bizarre bleeding of sky into land. While the game tries to model light reflecting off distant aircraft, the effect is more like the flashing beacon of a plane\'s running lights. <P>Nations: WWII Fighter Command comes with a manual that has some interesting but irrelevant background information on World War II, a decent discussion of aerial maneuvers, some background on the aircraft, and an adequate description of the game controls. The controls are configurable, though oddly enough, you need to hit the ""J"" key to enable the joystick at the beginning of every mission. Wingman commands are also sparse. <P>The game\'s flight model has three settings: relaxed, realistic, and ultrarealistic. Based on these descriptions, it would seem that Psygnosis is shooting straight at the hard-core simulation market, where success depends on the accuracy of the flight model. However, the flight physics are decidedly peculiar even in ultrarealistic mode: To say that the aircraft felt robust would be an understatement. Planes climbed at rates that seemed far out of step with other sims that boast realistic physics. <P>The most curious aspect of the flight model is the stall modeling, or rather the complete lack thereof. Planes could climb to a point at which they reached zero airspeed, only to slowly right themselves like gigantic paper airplanes - there is no loss of controlled flight whatsoever. In fact, planes can balance at the edge of a stall as though they were malformed helicopters. The game prominently displays the fact that the flight model has been approved by former RAF squadron leader and senior Eurofighter test pilot Craig Penrice, but the difference between this and other so-called realistic sims is so great that it\'s obvious something is wrong with Nations. <P>Damage modeling is equally lax. When attacking bombers, a few wing hits are often sufficient to send these giant planes spiraling to the ground. Explosions occur for no apparent reason. While the game boasts that ""planes will react to damage across 12 different aircraft systems,"" the effects of damage to your aircraft are marginal until the plane is actually destroyed. <P>Despite the decidedly watered-down flight physics, Nations does have some things going for it. There are a variety of missions that can be flown in the instant-action mode for those just wanting to get in the air and shoot down some bad guys. The range of aircraft and missions (bomber interceptions, strikes against land and sea targets, and more) ensures that those who are simply looking for an airborne diversion won\'t tire too quickly. In addition, there is a scripted campaign available for each nationality. Aircraft can be switched before starting a stand-alone mission, so if you\'re inclined to fly a P-51 Mustang as part of the Luftwaffe and chase an incoming B-24 raid, go right ahead. <P>Whatever problem you might have with the realism of the flight and damage models are certain to be exacerbated by the multiplayer game, where you have the option of playing with various ""power-ups,"" such as invincibility, faster speed, 2x damage, and so on. Fly through the spinning graphics and presto! You can even land at an airfield and pick up ""crates,"" which are combinations of the rocket, ammo, fuel, and health power-ups. It\'s unclear why a game that touts ""historical accuracy"" and ""incredibly realistic and detailed fighters"" would include something of this sort, and it\'s hard to imagine someone in search of an accurate model of a Hawker Typhoon being interested in flying through a ""health"" power-up. Conversely, someone looking for a casual airborne deathmatch might expect that something with ""true flight physics"" would be accompanied by a manual the size of an encyclopedia. What we have here is a failure to communicate. <P>Nations: WWII Fighter Command is a schizophrenic game. It seems targeted at the hard-core simulation audience, while the actual gameplay is simplistic and action-oriented. In fact, the only thing that might appeal to the hard-core sim player is the wording ""ultra-realistic"" on the box. This is sure to lead to disappointment, frustration, and many more returned games than would have been the case had Psygnosis been more straightforward. There could be an enjoyable game lurking in the box, but that depends very much on the buyer. Some might actually enjoy the arcade-action aspect of the multiplayer mode. But it\'s likely that most will find themselves the victims of a case of mistaken identity with a game that advertises itself so confusingly. -- <i>Bruce Geryk</i> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

791,Sin - PC,"['You are Colonel John R. Blade, who single-handedly restored order to Freeport in 2087, when the police force was dismantled. Now you face a new evil: Elexis Sinclaire has begun to biologically alter the streets of the city. Her mission to create genetically engineered mutants starts with the DNA altering drug, Dyforsanide. Blade uses hard-core weaponry to infiltrate the drug circuit and bring the brilliant biochemist to justice.', ""Sin is for the first-person shooter fan who wants more of the same, done just a little different, but done right. Too bad that's just the sort who'd be especially intolerant of its bugs and occasional shortcomings. Nevertheless, if you're looking for guns, blood, and action, not to mention one of the best deathmatch games of the year, you'll get your money's worth."", ""When it's at its best, Sin looks like a violent comic book or an exploitative action movie. The weapons are high-tech and over-the-top, the women are top-heavy, blood gushes all over the place, and most everything breaks or explodes eventually. As dictionary-definition tough guy John Blade, you must shoot your way through hundreds of gun-toting bruisers and nogoodniks. Sure, they all look the same, but they die in all kinds of different ways. They'll fly backward, spin out, clutch at their throats, clutch at their stomachs, collapse in place, or just plain blow to bits depending on how and where you shoot them. The motion-captured death throes of your enemies always look great, no matter how many you put out of their misery. Not that putting them out of their misery is an easy task; not all these guys know how to shoot straight, but they move pretty fast, and they won't go down easy. Of course, they'll go down a lot easier if you're a good shot - one of the best aspects of Sin is the hit detection, where you can shoot your enemy in any part of his body and see appropriate results. Sure, if you keep shooting that thug in the chest, he'll eventually go down; but even one or two shots to his head will do the job just the same. But don't get smug because the same laws apply to you. A lucky shot could even knock your weapon clean from your grip."", ""Most of the levels are intricately detailed, and some of them look very good. The game is richly colored all the way through, and while certain areas are a bit dark, for the most part, every area of the game looks plausible. While some of the level architecture starts to look a little plain, with too many right angles and too many long corridors, there are enough twists and unique challenges to keep you going and, more importantly, to keep you interested. In a throwback to Duke Nukem 3D, the levels also tend to be highly interactive, more so than the usual shooter. Go on, you know you want to flush those toilets, dial those phones, and open those file cabinets. Its graphics look awkward sometimes, often during the in-game cinematics, but for the most part, Sin's slick."", ""There's a lot of speech in Sin, what with Blade and his sidekick J.C. bantering back and forth all the time. Sure, real people don't talk like that, but the dialogue is appropriate in the context of the game, and for every joke that falls flat, there are at least a couple that work. Unfortunately, for the most part, Sin doesn't sound nearly as good as it should. Enemy thugs mutter the same boring lines over and over, to the point where it's all the more satisfying to shut them up. Most every gun at your disposal looks fantastic, but most every gun sounds meek and weak. It's almost sad - you've got Blade looking like a real tough customer, toting that monster machine gun in one hand and feeding ammo into it with the other, but the thing sounds like an electric razor running low on juice. Meanwhile, you've got an interactive soundtrack buzzing away in the background, and though it'll get you grooving to a good drumbeat once in a while, usually you either won't notice, or you'll want to turn it off."", ""After all, you must concentrate what with so many tough guys trying to lay you low all the time. The action in Sin is a lot of fun, and there's enough variety in between to keep the gunfights interesting. Often times, you must use your ingenuity as well as your ammunition. J.C. will help hack into various computer systems along the way, so you can disable security systems, open doors, and more. Otherwise, sometimes you must be sneaky; other times, you must think fast; and still other times, you must make some serious jumps. There's a lot more variety here than your average shooter, although that's not to suggest Sin is unlike anything you've ever seen."", ""The fact is, at its core, this here's your run-of-the-mill shooter. Unless you think it's a unique or revolutionary development to find the machine gun before the shotgun, you'll traverse familiar territory most of the way through Sin. But who cares? This is the shooter made for diehard fans of the genre, and if that's you, you'll like it a lot. After all, Sin rewards your finely honed aim more than any other Quake-style shooter, and the more experienced you are with the genre, the more you'll enjoy its wisecracks and shooter community in-jokes. On top of that, the single-player game is rather long, and you'll always have the deathmatch mode when you're through."", ""Sin includes many different deathmatch levels, some of which are straightforward but well-designed and some of which are pretty wild. One has you fighting on a moving train, while another puts you in a giant living room. Meanwhile, the hit detection only makes matters more interesting. Even the stock pistol can end a shootout pretty quickly if your aim is remarkable. But you needn't worry about the hit detection ruining deathmatches, with instant-death head shots left and right; Sin moves quickly, and most of the time, you'll have trouble hitting your opponent at all, let alone hitting him in the forehead. And when you need a break from deathmatch, Sin's even got a training facility that lets you skeet shoot with the shotgun, snipe with the rifle, and more; the game even tabulates a score based on your performance."", ""But all this seems practically pointless in light of Sin's bugs. Sure, multiplayer Sin works fine out of the box, but single-player loading times are unacceptable to the point where you'll have plenty of time to wonder if it's worth the trouble. Sin isn't easy, and dying in it starts to feel like a fate worse than death, what with two-minute load times as a consequence of every fatal mistake. And the problems don't stop there. The game's incompatible with certain popular sound cards, not to mention the first boss who stands perfectly still as you shoot him. Certainly, there will be a patch to address these problems. But no one wants a game that doesn't work well out of the box, and it isn't fair to force a customer to download a multimegabyte patch just to justify the purchase (the beta version of the patch is more than 10MB). Activision should be shipping the patch to every registered customer, complete with a rebate and personalized apology. But fat chance that's going to happen. So, for the time being, if you're looking for the best stand-in for Quake this year, you'll find it worth your while to shrug off the bugs. <i>--Greg Kasavin</i> <br />--<i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc.

792,Fighter Squadron - PC,"['This precision flight simulator really gives you dogfight action.

Thirty unique scenarios, different national allegiances, and three regions offer many mission options. Alter targets or airfields to create new undiscovered challenges.', 'The <i>Flight Model: The Fighter Squadron</i> flight model is based on a floating-point mathematical model, which calculates equations of motion to a much more accurate degree than integer mathematics.

In addition, players can switch planes within a squadron or change from pilot to tail gunner to bombardier on the fly during combat.']"
793,Battlezone 2 - PC,"['Jump in and take command in a fight that spans six exotic worlds with diverse environments--from steaming, swampy jungles crawling with deadly creatures, to rocky wastelands strewn with boiling lava pits, to ruined cities half-buried in nuclear snow. Players start by building a base from which they command a force of armored vehicles, infantry, and aircraft through a series of exploratory, offensive, and defensive missions. Gamers will drive a variety of tanks and walkers, pilot scout ships, and even jump out and fight an evil and challenging alien enemy on foot. Each side will choose from an arsenal of powerful weapons, including guided missiles, mortars, mines, and bazookas.', ""Activision's Battlezone has become better known for its poor sales than for the fact that it was a great game. It combined elements of real-time strategy and action games to create a hybrid that was at once unique, intuitive, and fun. Most everyone who played it loved it. Whatever the reason for Battlezone's disappointing sales, it certainly wasn't the quality of the game. Unfortunately, in what must have been an effort to make Battlezone's sequel more marketable, developer Pandemic Studios attempted to fix something that wasn't broken. As a result, Battlezone II is just a dumbed-down version of its predecessor. Battlezone was set in the late 1960s during a secret space race between the United States and the Soviet Union. The two superpowers on Earth were attempting to become superpowers on other worlds as well and were fighting to colonize and mine resources from the planets in the solar system. Toward the end of the game, a hostile alien race appeared that forced the warring earthlings to team up against the new threat. Their alliance is the basis for the sequel, which begins with you serving as a lieutenant for the ISDF, a multinational fighting force attempting to combat alien terrorism. Your apparent enemy is the Scion, an alien race that is building some sort of superweapon and destroying ISDF outposts. However, even from the beginning it is clear that something else is amiss. You are given conflicting orders, put in harm's way more than seems necessary, and then told to remain silent about your operations. There's something going on that's more than meets the eye, and watching the story unfold is one of the more enjoyable elements of Battlezone II. That the campaign's story is interesting enough to motivate you from mission to mission is a good thing, because Battlezone II's missions themselves are often boring. Whereas Battlezone was entertaining precisely because of the sheer amount of control it put it your hands, Battlezone II is dull because it isn't as flexible. Early missions typically tell you what to do, step by step, and lack any of the base building and resource gathering that made the first game fun. Instead, you just follow your commander around and perform various small tasks and listen to reports of other more interesting activities as they occur elsewhere in the field. The first ten missions in the game feel like tutorials, and it isn't until you've played through at least a dozen missions that you're given the ability to plan and build your base and assemble an army of units. Even when you finally take control of an army, it feels less significant than in Battlezone. Inevitably, you'll be planning your base defenses and preparing to build offensive units when you'll receive an order to go explore an event happening somewhere else, and you'll have to abandon the strategy portion of the game to go on some solo excursion. In fact, you spend so much time on short solo missions that it seems as if the real-time strategy elements of the game are almost an afterthought. <I>--Ron Dulin </I><br>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

796,Jack Nicklaus 6: Golden Bear Challenge - PC,"[""Jack Nicklaus's contribution to golf has long been an inspiration to golfers worldwide. With the Golden Bear Challenge, play as or against Jack. Be in his cleats as he tees off and putts. With lifelike golfers, camera control, and enhanced graphics, feel like you are really playing the green. Choose one of six golf courses and become a legend."", ""The Jack Nicklaus golf series has been a critical darling since it reemerged several years ago with the superb Jack Nicklaus 4, but that hasn't helped it fly off the shelves any faster. It and its sequel, Jack Nicklaus 5, received rave reviews but flat sales, leaving a cash-strapped Accolade to sell its crown jewel to Activision. The core design team, lead by Jack 4 creator Mike Franco, stayed with the product line when it jumped to Activision, and has created the superlative Jack Nicklaus 6: Golden Bear Challenge. Maybe with a fresh start at a new publisher, this game can finally find the audience it richly deserves."", ""Jack Nicklaus 6 is fundamentally very similar to its predecessors, but improves on it in many important ways. The game follows the pattern of not only offering a cutting-edge golf game with multiple courses, but also a stunningly powerful course editor. This mix makes it far and away the greatest value and most replayable golf game on the market. (Since many stores, like CompUSA, are selling it for only $20, it's even more of a value.) Owners of previous Jack Nicklaus games will see some familiar options and menu items, but once you get in the game, it becomes clear just how much has changed."", 'Jack Nicklaus 6 is a more streamlined, better-looking game. The minute you see that beautifully rendered fully 3D Nicklaus waggling at the tee, you can tell the visual benchmark has been raised. There are ten meticulously crafted, motion-captured, hardware-accelerated 3D golfers. Their fluid motion and animations look very natural, and they work perfectly in the 2D game world. Terrain is as sharp and photorealistic as Links, with excellent object modeling and amazing terrain effects and sloping. Some small animations, such as divots and flags, help bring the course alive with a minimum of fuss. Hardware acceleration is not mandatory, but it greatly smoothes the terrain and makes the golfers look spectacular. Without it, there is some slight pixelization; and even with it. there are some of the odd smoothing effects that tend to make hardware-accelerated graphics look a touch fuzzy at the edges. But overall, this is one fabulous-looking game.', ""The main screen and in-game options have been optimized to highlight this natural beauty. There are myriad preset camera angles (low, medium, high, and aerial from different angles) that can be viewed full screen or in moveable windows, including the hole map. You can also move and aim the camera anywhere on the course to create any view you like or set the game up to switch angles automatically. You can set the game up to view that 3D club from a tee's eye view, from the gallery, or from anywhere else, and you can shoot from these angles as well. The putting view is handled in the best manner I've ever seen. Instead of just using the traditional contoured grid, the developers have color-coded the grid so you can read the slope of the green with great accuracy. Add in some new (although repetitive) color commentary from Jim Nantz and Gary McCord as well as great flyovers and audio tips from Nicklaus, and you have a very full audio-visual experience."", ""All this eye-candy is brought together by excellent club control and physics. You can use two-click, three-click, or dynamic mouse swing interface, and each works just fine. Shots can be shaped very precisely, with the gamer in total control of the amount of fade and draw as well as trajectory. With one notable exception, physics are exemplary. Sand, rough, wind effects, and sidehill lies are all perfect. I did, however, struggle with the putting. Even with clobbering the hell out of my ball, all my putts fell short. I couldn't figure it out. I would even extend the aim line far beyond the cup and not make the second click, maxing out my power, and the ball would still fall short. It feels like a bug."", ""In a real switch, Jack Nicklaus 6 also incorporates some of the golfer profile elements from the Greg Norman and Microsoft Golf games. When creating your golfer, you can allot points to power, accuracy, bunker, short game, and putting to create a profile that will effect how your computer golfer performs. This doesn't mean good clicking skills are less important, but it does give the golfers more personality and create a more balanced variety of golfers. The only problem with the point allotment element of the golfer profile is that it's tied to the swing type (faster or slower). You get fewer points if you use a slower swing meter, which may stack the deck against novices."", ""The course designer has remained largely the same as in previous versions: You have complete control over the look and shape of an entire golf course. It's still a hole-based designer, so you must design one hole at a time instead of a course that shares features (like a river or mountain), but it's so damn good this hardly matters. The games ships with six courses, but literally hundreds of user-made courses can be imported with no graphical loss whatsoever. This instantly makes Jack 6 the game with the most courses by a considerable factor. Add in the best, most stable Internet golf play going, and you have the most full and well-rounded golf game on the market. Since you can find it for $20, this is far and away the beast deal in computer gaming."", 'If you have to buy only one golf game this year, make it Jack Nicklaus 6. <i>--T.

The simulation uses a great deal of full motion video in the introduction and cut scenes. It teaches the rudimentary flight pattern of a brand new, shiny, starship. The cadet learns the basics of spaceflight, including the options available on the bridge, and then undergoes training missions to retrieve objects in space, save innocent craft, and eventually engage in dogfights with Klingon Birds of Prey and Romulan battle cruisers.

Thankfully, some legendary officers are present to assist. William Shatner, Walter Koenig, and George Takei reprise their roles as Captain Kirk, Commander Chekov, and Captain Sulu, respectively.<P> <i>Starfleet Academy</i> splits time between 3-D starship battle action and 220 minutes of full-motion video sequences--particularly crisp in the <i>Starfleet Academy</i> DVD-ROM version--to drive the often-engaging storyline.

801,Enemy Engaged: Apache vs Havoc,"['About: East meets West in an apocalyptic clash of the superpowers as the US Apache Longbow and the Russian Havoc go head to head in the most incredible helicopter sim ever seen on a PC. Easily accessible yet deeply challenging gameplay, an intense and absorbing atmosphere and super- fast speeds make the Apache Havoc an amazing flying experience. Try two fully simulated combat helicopters: the US AH64D Apache Longbow and Russian Mil-28N Havoc B. Enjoy three vast combat zones featuring countless missions and dynamic campaigns in highly detailed and articulated 3D models and authentic flight dynamics.', 'If you take a look at combat helicopter sims, you have two fairly distinct categories. On the one hand, you have Longbow 2, a hard-core sim of the highest order that comes replete with excellent realism, top-notch graphics, and a relatively steep learning curve. On the other hand, you have games like Comanche 3 and Team Apache, which sacrifice varying degrees of realism in favor of fast-paced, easier gameplay and (in the case of Team Apache at least) multiplayer action. Now, along comes Apache Havoc, from Empire Interactive and Razorworks Studios. Where does this two-in-one sim fall along the spectrum of helicopter sims? Right smack in the middle. <P> Apache Havoc offers a great mix of realism and approachability, so that hard-core fans and novices alike should find a lot to like in the game. Not only do you get to fly either the AH-64D Apache Longbow or the Mil Mi-28 Havoc B, but you also get to take part in three different dynamic campaigns as well as some memorable multiplayer airborne deathmatches. <P> The game does not include an instant-action feature per se, but you can take off for free flights, dynamic missions, dynamic campaigns, or multiplayer missions (co-op or competitive). Free flight is a good place to start for novices, as the game\'s flight engine is reasonably accurate and therefore requires some practice to master. Most of the individual realism settings (wind, retreating blade stall, and ground effect, among others) can be dialed up or down to accommodate your skill and preference. Also, the game includes a basic three-level difficulty setting that affects the overall challenge of the missions and campaigns. <P> The campaigns in Apache Havoc take place in three global hot spots: Cuba, the former Russian state of Georgia, and the ""Golden Triangle"" of Myanmar, Thailand, and Laos. Each campaign is dynamic and somewhat reminiscent of EF-2000 and F-22 Total Air War. The unique twist to Apache Havoc\'s campaigns is that you begin with only one and a half hours on the campaign clock. That clock ticks down as you fly missions - you gain some time if you accomplish a mission, and you lose extra time when you fail (extra, meaning time beyond what you spent trying to accomplish the mission). When you run out of time, the campaign is over, and whichever side is closest to its objective goals wins. A clock may not be the most exciting of motivators, but it works well in Apache Havoc. <P> One thing I didn\'t much like about the early stages of each campaign (dynamic or not) was that the missions are all pretty dry. Recon, scout, and combat air patrol are the rule of the day, and for a while these missions tend to come up empty in terms of targets, let alone excitement of any kind. Even worse, when you complete some of the basic scout missions, the computer maps an insanely long return route to a base several map grids away. The result is not only a boring mission, but also a very, very long boring mission. The ""skip ahead"" feature from F-22 Total Air War would be welcome in Apache Havoc. Still, once the campaign heats up a bit and you complete some of the simpler hops, you\'ll have better missions to fly. <P> While the graphics in Apache Havoc are not quite up to the sheer beauty of Longbow 2 on all fronts, they are exceptionally good. The unit models in particular are excellent and highly detailed, and the weather and weapons effects border on spectacular. Also, the level of detail on the ground is fantastic - particularly on airfields, where you can see all the other aircraft and support equipment. The terrain can be a bit uninspiring at altitude, but you\'re not really supposed to be up that high anyway (this is an attack helicopter remember). Once you\'re down near the ground, following rivers and popping up over tree lines, the terrain quality becomes very immersive. <P> The trees themselves are a touch disappointing, though, since they\'re just blocks of space with treelike textures on them. And the colors can be a bit garish at times, but otherwise the game looks great. This is especially true at high resolution (the game runs as high as 1280x1024). Unfortunately, the developers created cockpit graphics for 640x480 only. For invisible cockpit fans like me, this is no big deal, but if you like to keep the cockpit graphics on while flying, the ridiculously small, floating 640x480 cockpit on your 1024x768 screen might prove annoying. Also, Apache Havoc can be a brutish resource hog - even on a Pentium II 450 with 128MB RAM and dual Voodoo2 cards, the game chugged whenever I flew over an area with lots of buildings or ships. <P> The music in Apache Havoc is techno-pop, which seems out of place but quickly fades to repetitive background noise after a few minutes. The sound effects, on the other hand, can be remarkable. Though the radio chatter is jerky and occasionally cryptic, the vehicle sounds are excellent. Flying low over a patch of trees looking for a column of enemy armor (which seemed to be actively trying to hide from me), I actually heard the tank treads below before I could spot the individual tanks. Can you really hear tanks from inside an Apache cockpit? I have no idea, but it was damn cool in the game. <P> Apache Havoc is a good all-around sim that impresses despite its odd assortment of quirks.

Protect Mother Russia from the advancing Germans. <P> Next stop, the modern era: Solve the transportation problems facing the modern world from 1950 to 2005.

The United States is a watery wasteland. The Mediterranean is an empty basin with a blossoming Eden. Antarctica is a promising agricultural center. The heady task of providing rail systems for this strange and exotic world falls upon your shoulders. No doubt, only the most ingenious solutions will do."", 'It\'s an adage that add-ons can be tougher than the original game. That adage applies in spades to the Railroad Tycoon II expansion pack, The Second Century. For fans of Railroad Tycoon II who may have exhausted the original scenarios and campaigns, The Second Century adds some hefty new challenges. <P> The Second Century consists of 18 new scenarios, including five new campaigns. Most of the features added to the game consist of new industries, buildings, and trains - relatively few new gameplay features have been added, the most significant being the ability to have cargo carry through intermediate stations. <P> All the scenarios are fairly difficult, though some are downright fiendish. Most of the difficulty lies in either the victory conditions, which can be quite demanding, or the terrain, which can make laying rail a hair-pulling proposition. Since the real value of this pack is the scenarios, let\'s dive into railroading\'s second century by taking a look at the most compelling of these. <P> The historical scenarios are split up between late 19th century and near-modern (post World War I) eras. One of the more interesting campaigns is the North to Alaska campaign. There are no competitors, and you get an automatic stipend of $150,000 per year from the US Government. The year is 1930, and the country is in the midst of the Great Depression. All you have to do is build a rail line from Seattle to Fairbanks as a sort of public works project to keep people employed. Of course, if you can get rich in the process.... <P> It seems like a piece of cake, and in fact, it\'s one of the easier campaigns for you to achieve at least minimum victory conditions. But it\'s something of a precursor to later maps, because right away, you\'re faced with a difficult track-laying procedure. It\'s simple enough to build a line from Seattle to Vancouver, but stretching beyond Canada\'s west coast metropolis is a tough proposition due to a seemingly impenetrable mountain range. Here, your inability to build tunnels in Railroad Tycoon II is a frustration, but if you study the map carefully, you\'ll see you can successfully construct a switchback over the mountain range between Vancouver and Williams Lake. <P> In the Battle of Britain campaign, there\'s no stock market, no competition, you can\'t build new stations, and you can\'t buy new locomotives. The time scale is different, too, as the campaign covers a scant 12 days; most Railroad Tycoon veterans are used to multiyear campaigns. This campaign is Railroad Tycoon II\'s version of that venerable circus arcade game whack-a-mole crossed with a trace-the-maze game. <P> The gist of the campaign is this: You\'re managing the British rail system during the Battle of Britain (1940). You can repair six segments of track per day. You have to move a certain amount of cargo in the form of war material and troops to specific locations. It becomes an exercise in finding the key connector routes and making sure they stay repaired. Of course, as time passes, segments of tracks get bombed, and trains get strafed. You have to keep your trains moving and key track segments repaired. While interesting as a sort of puzzle, it\'s an almost mind-numbing exercise. <P> Mother Russia is a much more compelling strategic exercise than the Battle of Britain campaign. Here, you actually affect the progress of Germany\'s Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of Russia in June 1941. By moving men and material around, you can counterbalance the military strength of the Germans. This is handled somewhat artificially through ""strength points."" As war material and troops pour into a region, the total strength goes up - but the Germans are building up, too. If the Russian strength in a given sector falls below that of the German military machine, you lose that territory. The key is to be very patient and keep the game speed down low. You start with a fairly skimpy cash reserve, and though you do incur the usual costs, they\'re offset by a steady income flow in the early stages.<P> Some of the most interesting and challenging scenarios are the hypothetical ones. Some take place in a future era, others in hypothetical regions. <P> Take Mediterranean Basin, for instance. Imagine that the Mediterranean Sea has been completely drained of water. I know, it\'s a tough sell, but you can do it. Now you have the entire former seabed to exploit. But the terrain is fiendishly difficult in places. Most major cities lie on what was once mainland Europe, North Africa, or islands - and that means steep climbs. <P> This one is actually great fun because of the start date: 2006. You not only get some nifty new high-tech trains, but also some new industries - the weirdest being the Geocore power plant. Unfortunately, you really need to start out with some moneymaking lines on the European mainland to start generating hard currency, so it\'s some time before you start into the Med itself. <P> The Antarctica campaign lets you build on the southernmost continent. This one is tough because you have to ignore your past RRT experience. In the standard game, one common strategy is to build a few short, fairly lucrative passenger lines to keep the cash coming to fund your more ambitious projects, not to mention industry acquisitions. But there are relatively few settlements in Antarctica (no surprise there). So you have to focus on connecting resources to manufacturing, then finding outlets for the goods. There are a number of port cities that demand certain raw materials, but those are limited to just a few items. It\'s challenging also because you only have a couple different trains to pick from. <P> Seattle Metro is probably the toughest scenario in the game, and it\'s a doozy. You\'re presented with a map of the greater Seattle area, and your goal is to build an effective mass transit system. The scale is much different, covering a much smaller geographical region than most RRT maps. In addition, there are lots of pesky houses and commercial property to make your track laying a nightmare. The final complication is that, unlike most Railroad Tycoon maps, there are many different types of passengers. You really have to consider the different types of passengers in planning your routes and consider the demand of each particular station. Even after you\'ve gotten a few stations up and running, you have to keep checking them, because the demand for passenger types keeps shifting. <P> There are certainly more scenarios that I didn\'t have time to explore. Imagine developing a railroad system in China or keeping Berlin fed during the Berlin Crisis. Or consider the challenge of building a railroad between France and Great Britain - but beware those Chunnel expenses! <P> The game comes with a full map/scenario editor and supports up to four players in multiplayer mode, either on a local area network or over the Internet. If you have a lot of Railroad Tycoon II saved games, and you get The Second Century, be sure to download the 1.51 patch, which fixes some problems with loading older save-game files. <P> The bottom line is that The Second Century is a tough but compelling add-on to Railroad Tycoon II. You rapidly discover that your past strategies no longer work, and you have to really think to develop new ones. It\'s certainly a cerebral set of challenges, but if you\'re a serious fan of the game, this is a terrific add-on. If you\'re just starting into Railroad Tycoon II, you may want to pass on this until you master the first game. <i>--Loyd Case</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Second, did you spend most of your time ramming the aforementioned toy cars into one another and lighting them on fire?If you answered ""yes"" to these questions, there\'s a good chance you\'ll enjoy .', ""But enough psychoanalysis. Sure, it's fun to cruise around the cities in GTA, running over innocent pedestrians and hijacking cars, then using them to crash into others for points. But your real purpose in the game is trying to get noticed by the local crime syndicate. To do that, you must successfully complete jobs for big points. Get enough points, and you'll advance to the next level and go on to other cities and bigger jobs. The more successful you are, the more difficult the jobs get. Some will be in multiple parts; others will have a time limit. And just because you work for the wrong side of the law doesn't mean you're safe from harm. Blow up a car with a rocket launcher while standing too close, and you'll be a crispy criminal. The life of crime is dangerous and risky. Even if you don't get killed or severely hurt, the cops will be after you all the time."", ""That's why patience is important. You can drive around recklessly all you want, but you'll constantly have the cops on your tail, interfering with your assigned job and the points you'll need to get to the next level. The easiest way to get the cops after you is by running over people or crashing into a squad car, and, unless you're sadistic, you usually run over people accidentally because of reckless driving."", ""It can take as long as two hours to achieve one million points and proceed to the second level. Later on, you'll need three million, which can take as long as five to six hours to achieve. This is somewhat frustrating because you can't save your game during levels. Since the game comes with a Windows 95 version you can multitask, so you don't have to tie up your PC playing the game, but if your system crashes, you're out of luck."", ""GTA is fun, and it has some excellent features. Vehicles all have appropriate physics. They steer, brake, accelerate, and handle like you might expect. Sports cars can stop and turn on a dime, but aren't very durable (if your car takes too much damage, it won't run properly and might even explode), while trucks have a large turning radius and take a long time to get up to speed, but are fairly durable. Small details - like the beeping sound a truck makes when it backs up, the various engine sounds, or the way pedestrians scream and run if you drive on the sidewalk - add to GTA's cool factor."", ""Once you get good at driving the cars, especially the fast sports cars, you can really zip through traffic. On roadways, if you gently tap the turn buttons, you can change lanes to avoid traffic without compensating for recentering the car, since it does so for you automatically. That makes a big difference when you're speeding down one of the multilane interstates. Another feature that really helps is how the perspective zooms in and out, determined by your rate of speed - it zooms in when you're going slow and out when you're going fast to expand your field of vision. The only flaw with this technique is that it doesn't always zoom in right away, so a tall building can block the view of your car until it does."", ""GTA is a good game that is highly recommended at a bargain price, but won't win any awards. Wanna-be sociopaths who can deal with the shortcomings will have a lot of fun, and if you could save games within levels, it would come even more highly recommended. <i>--Tasos Kaiafas</i><br />--<i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc.

817,Battlezone Gold - PC,"['The Battlezone is the full moon base established when the real ""Space Race"" began. Space programs launched by both Soviet and American militaries search for valuable bio-metal deposits. Only one country can have control and it is your mission to control the alien technology before they do. Battlezone Gold packs greater fighting power with the inclusion of two mission packs and the official strategy guide.', 'Some folks might accuse Activision of duplicity for naming its newest action/strategy game Battlezone, but aside from the fact that both games put you in the cockpit of a tank, it has about as much in common with that arcade classic as an IBM PC Jr. does with a full-blown Pentium gaming system. <P> Yep, anyone who picks up this Battlezone expecting a graphics-heavy retread of the original will be in for a big surprise - but luckily it\'ll be an extremely pleasant one. Simply put, Battlezone is one of the best strategy games I\'ve wrapped my brain (and trigger finger) around in a long, long time. And I\'ve got three words for anyone who does complain that Activision stuck the Battlezone name on this product just to boost sales: get over it. Hell, I wouldn\'t care if they\'d somehow managed to call it Super Mario\'s Metal Mayhem if it meant more people would be tempted to check it out. <P> Battlezone has the look and feel of a futuristic shooter, but it\'s actually set in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Seems that a meteor shower a decade earlier left behind some other-worldly stuff called ""bio-metal"" - the product of an alien technology that can not only be used to craft weapons of incredible power and durability, but which also seems to be sentient. (Now that would have made a decent Pet Rock!) Uncle Sam wants to use the bio-metal to bring the Cold War to an end, but - you guessed it - the Soviets found out about the bio-metal and are just as desperate as you to get their Commie hands on it first. <P> The quest for the miracle metal leads both nations into space to track down the mother lode - and hopefully uncover any other alien leftovers that could lead to ultimate victory. Beginning on the Earth\'s moon, the Americans and Russkies start to unravel the mysteries behind the bio-metal, leading to a race that takes them from Earth\'s closest planetary neighbors to the harsh worlds of Jupiter\'s moons Io and Titan - and to the realization that they must unite to defeat a force greater than both of them. It\'s a pretty good setup, if for no other reason than it means you get to enjoy seven types of terrain, each with its own distinct look and particular obstacles and hazards. And the narration between missions gives the whole affair a decidedly personal touch (though it does get a bit too melodramatic now and then). <P> But what really makes Battlezone so special is the way it blends the adrenaline rush of first-person action games with the strategy and resource management of Red Alert (or one of its imitators). Sure, you\'ll see plenty of combat from the cockpit of your tank, but personal victories mean little or nothing in the grand scheme of things. At the same time that you\'re on the lookout for roving Russians, you must launch an extensive construction program, starting by guiding your Recycler to a geyser where it can draw power. The Recycler converts scrap metal (collected by Scavengers) that\'s used to build everything from tanks and turrets to factories, armories, and power plants. Once you\'ve manufactured offensive and defensive weapons, they fall under your command: Although the game\'s AI means they\'ll always attack nearby enemies, you\'ll need to give them specific assignments to maximize their firepower and range. If that weren\'t enough, you can jump from your basic tank and hunt down enemies with your plasma rifle or take control of almost any vehicle - from the utilitarian tug to the havoc-wreaking bomber. <P> Not every mission involves constant construction. One mission is a solo outing where you must use a sniper rifle to kill a Soviet pilot and commandeer his ship for a spy run; another actually penalizes you for overbuilding by allowing the Soviets to reach the objective first if you waste time amassing a heavy firepower advantage. For the most part, however, you can expect to be constantly cranking out various units and structures while blasting enemy forces into proverbial space dust. <P> Having this much control laid at your feet could be a major pain in a game using a first-person perspective, but the Battlezone interface is so well designed that after just a few hours of play it\'s as comfortable as a pair of old jeans. With just a little practice you\'ll be able to zoom toward an objective while sending reinforcements to a trouble spot and ordering your Recycler and Factory to keep pumping out units. <P> It\'s hard not to compare the resource-management and construction facets of Battlezone to those in the Command & Conquer games: Recyclers have pretty much the same role as Mobile Construction Vehicles, Scavengers work like Harvesters, Factories produce offensive and defensive units the way War Factories do - well, you get the idea. But hey, if you\'re gonna nick an idea or two from somewhere, those C&C games are a pretty good place to start, especially if you\'re going to give the genre a whole new feel with a first-person interface. And the arsenal of weapons in Battlezone puts it in a class of its own. Howitzers can rain death on enemy bases, targeting guns ""paint"" a target so it can be tracked by guided missiles, Day Wrecker missiles detonate just above ground level with the power of a blockbuster bomb, magnetic ""curtains"" provide temporary invulnerability - all these and more lead to a huge number of tactical possibilities. <P> It\'s been said that you eat with your eyes, and if that cliche holds true for games then Battlezone is a tempting treat indeed. Direct3D support makes for some of the best outdoor terrain and detailed vehicles I\'ve seen in a game, and it\'s topped off with special effects such as fiery explosions, missile trails, thick clouds of haze, lightning bolts, and other visual goodies. This stuff isn\'t just eye candy, either; it all works together to create an intensely immersive experience. There are a few graphical glitches - white dots where textures weren\'t connected and a rapidly jerking plasma rifle are notable examples - but they were so few and far between I hardly gave them a second thought. <P> Not counting the tutorials, the single-player game includes 27 missions - 17 played from the US side and eight as the Soviets. Figuring that most gamers will want to saddle up as the good guys, the American missions progress so that you\'re given more to do as you get acquainted with the game; the Russian missions are supposedly aimed at ""experienced"" commanders, but by the time you\'ve played four or five US missions you should be able to handle at least some of the Soviet outings. <P> There are a couple of cupcake missions, but they\'re compensated for by the inclusion of some real bears. The charm of the mission design, though, is that there\'s rarely a single ""right"" way to do things: Several options are open to you, giving you the chance to choose the one that best suits your skills and style of play. <P> And should you tire of the single-player missions, Battlezone\'s got some extremely intense multiplayer options to keep the good feeling going even longer. The strategy mode (which gives you the same type of control as in the single-player game) provides a distinct experience each time out because there are so many approaches each opponent can take. I really didn\'t expect deathmatch to be as appealing - after all, you just run around and grab power-ups and kill everyone else - but after just a few matches I found myself enjoying it more than I\'d thought possible. There\'s even a map editor to create your own multiplayer arenas. <P> There are two snags: Latency and the fact that you can start games before all players have joined (which gives the early bird a definite advantage in strategy mode). Some players on Activision\'s Battlezone server appeared to be completely oblivious to the concept of high latency, resulting in dropped packets (which means vital stuff like missile hits might not be transmitted), so if you do play on the server, you probably should start a game and only allow players with latencies below 500ms to join. <P> Battlezone is dotted with a few minor blemishes. Perhaps most noticeable is that the AI for friendly units can be a little dicey: Scavengers will sometimes stop their task and park outside Recyclers, for instance, and some offensive units aren\'t smart enough to follow a Recycler you\'re relocating if you told them to defend it while it was stationary. There\'s no way to order a scout or tank to follow a scavenger, tug, or transport unless the unit to be escorted is within your targeting range; there should be a way to assign an escort to any unit regardless of its location. <P> Control can be a bit of a problem for mousers - I couldn\'t find any way to increase the speed at which I turned left and right using the mouse, and the cursor was a bit floaty for me. Finally, the addition of a coordinate system would allow you to send units anywhere on the map; as it stands, you can only send them to Nav beacons, construction units, or a place you designate with the aiming reticle. <P> So how critical are these problems? I\'ll put it like this: Ninety percent of the reason I mentioned them is because that\'s my job, not because they bothered me much when I was playing. And I\'m not saying that as a sop to Activision, or anyone else for that matter; I\'m saying it because it\'s the truth. <P> Listen, I see games every day; it\'s what I do for a living. When I load one up and start raving about it to all my friends after a few hours of play, I know I\'ve got the real deal on my hands - and that\'s just what Battlezone is. This might be the most perfect blend of two gaming genres since... well, I don\'t know when.1998 might be only three months old, but it\'s going to take a lot of effort for someone to crank out a better action/strategy game than Battlezone.<I>--Stephen Poole</I> <P> --<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

822,F-22 Raptor - PC,"['BRAND NEW SHIPS IN ECO-FRIENDLY WHITE PAPER SLEEVE. Over 10 years in business - huge software selection, excellent customer service!', 'Last year NovaLogic released F-22 Lightning II, a diverting arcade-like sim that made inflated claims for the realism and accuracy of its flight model. After F-22 hit, NovaLogic managed to cement a relationship with Lockheed Martin for the rights to create sims based upon its aircraft, attempting to shut out other manufacturers in the process. (NovaLogic later denied that it was trying to freeze out the competition, but its initial releases featured the phrase ""exclusive rights"" prominently.) When the flight sim community rose up in outrage over this (particularly in light of NovaLogic\'s complete inability to create a flight model more realistic than that found in, say, Descent), NovaLogic backed off. But it still had this swell deal with Lockheed and needed to start making it pay out. <P> F-22 Raptor is the result. It is essentially F-22 Lightning II reissued. The radical differences in the two games made a whole new release essential. Differences such as the ""Lockheed Martin Fighter Series"" label on the box and, um, let\'s see. Oh yeah, the textures don\'t pop as much. And, er, well, it is native Windows 95. There\'s MMX support. The interface art looks a bit different. I\'m reaching here, folks.... Help me out. <P> There have been some very minor enhancements made. Some new textures and fogging effects have been added, and the engine seems to run a bit smoother. Ground textures have some filtering on them, for that nice angora sweater look, instead of the slight pixelization of the original. Texture popping is less of an issue than in the original, where I\'d watch mountain tops draw. But these are things for a patch, not a whole new game. The cockpit and view modes have not changed at all. <P> There have been some slight modifications made to the flight model in order to inch it closer in the direction of reality, but turns still feel off. I know we don\'t have the reports on the F-22 yet, so it\'s very difficult to comment on the way Raptor handles. Some drag and fuel consumption codes appear to have been added, and there is some speed bleeding. The fact is, we can\'t be certain about the flight model since the advanced design of the F-22 may indeed have many automatic and self-correcting features. But the physics of the world just don\'t feel convincing, and the avionics are certainly simplified. <P> The cockpit is set up in such a way that you cannot easily monitor instruments. The one pop-up screen offered is the attack/nav display, which only serves to highlight the failure of NovaLogic to create a convincing and useful information display. There isn\'t enough range or target information to make the display usable. Plus, it only offers the 90-degree forward-facing sensor arc, not the 360-degree defensive display, which is crucial to situational awareness. This means that you\'ll spend a lot of blind time glancing at instruments. I had a great deal of trouble tracking inbound missiles with these instruments. Either create a proper set of overlays (a la Navy Fighters), or keep the instruments visible in the cockpit view at all times. Like Interactive Magic, NovaLogic has also failed to include a moving map display. This means that if you suffer navigation systems failure, you can\'t finish a mission using VRF. Does the F-22 have an MMD? If it doesn\'t, the pilots at least have knee boards. An in-game map is essential. <P> On the plus side, there is some modeling of individual system failures. Enemy AI is vigorous, and wingman AI is improved over past NovaLogic titles. The graphics are sharp and smooth without 3Dfx, though they are not up to the current standard of hardware-only titles. The campaign is semidynamic, with some store tracking and a persistent battlefield (destroyed objects stay destroyed). Missions are still scripted, rather than dynamically generated. The five minicampaigns all run together, as you begin in Angola, then move on to Jordan, Russia, Columbia, and Iran. There is also a number of training and stand-alone missions. <P> Raptor is not done with a great deal of depth or complexity, but it is done in an entertaining and accessible way. The feel is most like US Navy Fighters, with a hop-in-and-take-care-of-business approach. Its ease of use and simple controls make it an ideal midrange sim for many. The debatable claims for hard-core realism aside, Raptor still suffers from a few problems, such as the avionics and map display issues. Furthermore, it feels like a rip-off. There is simply not enough that\'s new or different to justify a whole new game. This is the game owners of Lightning II deserved in the first place. <i>--T.

828,Star Trek: Borg - The Ultimate Interactive Movie,"['Next Generation game in which you inhabit the role of Cadet Qaylan Furlong, whose father was killed by the Borg. You will be allowed to go back 10 years in time, on the ship where your father was killed, and be given the opportunity to save him and the Federation.', 'In Simon & Schuster Interactive\'s Star Trek: Borg, you\'re a green Starfleet Academy cadet, logging training hours aboard a Federation starship... and haunted by the memory of your father\'s death, at the hands of the Borg at the battle of Wolf 359. When the dreaded Borg suddenly show up on a beeline course for mother Terra, your ship is selected to join the battlegroup which will engage them, and all trainee personnel are ordered to evacuate. The Borg are a nasty, formidable enemy, and Starfleet Command doesn\'t need any new fish wet-ends like you panicking at the wrong moment in a battle where every action and second counts. The fact that you have reason to want to stay and fight - the fact that your father was killed at the Wolf 359 massacre, aboard the ill-fated USS Righteous - means jack-all to the high command. You can leave and like it... or you can just leave. <P> As you bitterly pack your meager cadet\'s belongings, the infamous alien entity known as ""Q"" (played by John DeLancie) appears in your stateroom and offers you a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity: With his help, you can travel back in time to the bridge of the Righteous, moments before the ship was lost, and wreak a little vengeance. And maybe - just maybe - save him and change the future for yourself and for everyone else. Borg has it all: time travel; the smarmy, omnipotent Q; the scariest alien race ever to populate the Star Trek universe; and an angry, orphaned cadet\'s passionate (and very un-Federation) wish for brutal retribution. It\'s a promising broth very difficult to spoil. <P> Simon & Schuster Interactive evidently has many, many cooks at its disposal. <P> Borg is that most dubious of game prospects - an ""interactive movie."" Initially whisked aboard the bridge of the Righteous as a Christmas Carol-esque presence nobody can hear or see, you are witness (via full-screen video) to what may be the final moments of the ship (and your father) all over again - and then you are given the opportunity to directly interact with the past as the Borg invade the ship and attempt to drop the shields of the Righteous. At various times during the continuously playing movie that is 99% of the game, the player is given the option to solve puzzles, attack, or analyze people, objects, or Borg (which are, strictly, neither) with a modified tricorder provided by Q. Virtually every decision point in the game, if not every decision point, is a try-and-die affair, resulting in a short cut-movie with a rawthuh disappointed Q telling you what a moron you are, or giving you a condescendingly patient (and, I must admit, rather insultingly cool) primer on how to use the mouse on your computer. <P> Borg is infuriating not only because of the lousy (indeed, almost nonexistent) gameplay, but also because of the obvious tremendous expense and potential of this absolutely lame FMV-fest. The talent involved could have gone to good use, somewhere. As the irritating, haughty (and ever-so-slightly swishy) Q, John DeLancie gives a superb performance that\'s wasted here. (In one spectacular, skin-crawling death-sequence, he stares at a Defense Systems panel, his eyes wide, shouting, ""THE BORG ARE FIRING, WE\'RE GONNA DIE!"" Then - all the mock terror dropping from his face in an instant - he leers knowingly toward the camera and, with a horrible grin, whispers, ""And it\'s your fault,"" as the ship and your father get blown to bits around him.) Ditto the dialogue and story elements - all fine in themselves, wrapped up in a quick-pick-a-path mess with the budget of a motion picture and the gameplay of... well, a motion picture. <P> (And despite my usual stance on this sort of thing, I don\'t even feel bad about blowing any plot points or particular surprises. I figure I\'ll just end up saving you the trouble of buying this dog.) <P> A few words to Trek enthusiasts: No matter how many times some game company out there does something like this to you, just close your eyes and keep repeating to yourself: Interplay\'s Starfleet Academy is coming. Starfleet Academy is coming.... <i>--Chris Hudak</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved. Reproduction in whole or in part in any form or medium without express written permission of GameSpot is prohibited.</i> -- <i>GameSpot Review</i><br /><br />It makes a weird kind of sense that this game would come on a hybrid CD. After all, the raison d\'etre of the Borgs, the eponymous villains of this episode of the venerable Star Trek franchise, is to ""assimilate"" alien races - i.e., take into their ""collective"" the technologies (and bodies) of those they come across. <P>That said, this CD-ROM\'s developers should have spent a little more time studying the Borg\'s methods. Star Trek: Borg doesn\'t have the OS smarts to switch screen resolutions to the mandatory 640 x 480 pixels. (If you launch it at any other resolution, you\'ll get an error message stating: ""You must change your monitor resolution and restart your computer."" Hello? You don\'t need to restart a Mac.) Other irritations include a strange save scheme and no way to open a saved game from within play in case you make a wrong move. <P>Speaking of making wrong moves, that\'s what you\'ll be doing, mostly. Gameplay consists of watching from a first-person perspective what seems to be an episode of Star Trek, and suddenly having to click at Point A or Point B at ""Decision Points,"" which are usually cued by characters who turn to the camera and say, ""What do you think?"" A few puzzles are simple enough if you\'ve checked out the scene with a special tricorder given to you by Q (oh, he\'s the ""omnipotent godbeing"" who\'s tossed you back through time to save your father from the Borg invasion 10 years ago and... well, John deLancie is great as Q, and gets all the good lines). However, many of the puzzles\' answers are obscure, and some even require sort-of cheating: Sometimes the only way to continue the game is to quit and restart at the last saved point. (Here\'s where a ""restore"" function would\'ve been nice.) If you fail, Q may reset the game to the Decision Point, or you may watch a grisly endgame, but either way, there\'s a long video replay to sit through. Tension and fear may be a valid experience in this game, but frustration shouldn\'t be. <P>That said, there are reasons to recommend Star Trek: Borg. As long as RAM Doubler or Virtual Memory is disabled, the full-screen video runs nearly perfectly on a 7600/120; the sets and costumes and sets are, likewise, impeccable (a fan said); the acting is good; there seem to be fewer plot holes in this game than in the average episode, and at times, there is a genuine urgency and intensity to the experience. In fact, this adventure might be, at times, too grim for children. <P>Simon & Schuster is to be commended for releasing this product simultaneously for the Mac and PC (and coincidentally close to the release of the new movie, ""Star Trek: First Contact""); however, given some of the technical frustrations, an extra week or two in development could\'ve made the experience that much more stellar. - D.

829,Delta Force - PC,"[""At first glance, NovaLogic's Delta Force doesn't look like the sort of action game you might expect to see here at the tail end of 1998. After all, a game in this genre has to be 3D accelerated to be good, right? Not necessarily. If ever there was a game that proved the value of gameplay over graphics, it's Delta Force."", 'Delta Force is a game of special forces combat against terrorist and insurgent forces. You can play the game from either a first- or third-person viewpoint. You can even do both at the same time, thanks to the picture-in-picture feature that lets you see your first-person view in a small window while playing the game from a third-person POV.', 'Delta Force includes five single-player campaigns, each against a different foe in a different theater: a drug lord in Peru, terrorists in Chad, terrorists in Indonesia, insurgents in Uzbekistan, and more terrorists on the Russian island of Novaya Zemlya. The foliage (which is universally sparse), the buildings, and the bad guys all vary from region to region, though the landscapes are all pretty much the same except for color changes (green for jungle, tan for the desert, white for the snowy arctic circle, and so on). Rolling hills and plains pitted by deep, smooth canyons are pretty much the standard terrain type here.', 'The attack-and-destroy missions are interspersed with a healthy number of other scenarios. For example, there are a few missions where you will have to infiltrate a base to steal a laptop or some other source of intelligence data. Others include rescue missions, convoy ambushes, and (in one of my favorites) laser-designating targets for naval bombardment. Overall, the mission design in Delta Force is very strong.', 'One point where Delta Force could stand some improvement, however, is in the mission-planning phase. As mentioned earlier, you have no say in the mission plan itself. You can alter your starting equipment and weaponry, but the mission waypoints are fixed - and suicidal. Nearly every mission is planned out so that your first dozen or so steps will take you straight into the heart of heavy, concentrated enemy fire. The best way to complete most missions is to ignore the waypoints entirely and make your way slowly around the objective, sniping all visible bad guys from extreme range before moving in to mop up the survivors.', ""Then again, the computer-controlled good guys aren't often much help anyway (particularly Charlie Team, which was about as useful as red shirts in Star Trek). For some reason, these poor fools got wiped out early in almost every single mission, often before I could even make it to my first few waypoints (maybe that's why they wouldn't leave their hole on the last mission). The AI for enemy troops, on the other hand, is quite good. Unlike in Rainbow Six, a bad guy in Delta Force will most certainly respond when you blow away his buddy - and so will a dozen or so of his comrades. Opening up with an automatic weapon from an unprotected spot is sheer suicide, as the bad guys will quickly home in on your stream of fire and wipe you out."", ""The tepid graphics engine does not ruin this game. So long as you have the hardware to run it at 640x480 with 16 million colors (the aforementioned Pentium II 300 can do this just fine), Delta Force can actually be quite impressive from a visual standpoint. The maps are all very well designed, as are the various bases, airfields, and other objectives you'll encounter. The player and enemy animations are excellent and realistic. The death animations even vary depending on where a character is shot. And the rolling terrain makes sniping a real challenge, as you often have to wait for a bad guy to pop up from behind a rise before pulling the trigger. The idea was to create believable outdoor environments where combat could take place at extreme ranges (we're talking about distances of up to a kilometer here), and Delta Force truly delivers in that respect."", 'The game\'s Dolby Pro Logic 3D positional sound and excellent sound effects make the battlefield even more realistic and immersive. The sound of bullets whizzing by is often the only indicator you have that you\'re under fire. When you hear slugs hitting the ground all around you, you know that it\'s time to move and move fast. Also, the shouts of your enemies (which come complete in a language native to the theater) will let you know whether or not you\'ve been spotted. Once, after shooting a Peruvian at point-blank range, I heard him yell ""Medico! Medico!"" before crumpling to the ground.', ""The weapon sound effects, from the suppressed H&amp;K MP5 to the mighty M249 SAW, are utterly fantastic - possibly the best I've ever heard. In multiplayer games, the weapon sounds of 32 players combine into an unforgettable din. When you enter a multiplayer game of Delta Force on NovaWorld, NovaLogic's free gaming service, you will feel like you're entering a real combat zone."", ""In general, multiplayer games of Delta Force are incredibly fun - when they work. NovaWorld is very obviously lacking in the bandwidth department, and reports are flying all over the Net about difficulties getting this game to work well over modem and generic Internet links. Still, if you catch NovaWorld on a good day and at a good time, you're in for a treat. Delta Force online is one of the most enjoyable and thrilling multiplayer experiences I've ever had. Game variants like capture the flag, king of the hill, and team deathmatch are a real blast no matter how many players are in a game."", 'Delta Force is a very impressive game overall, despite the limitations of the graphics engine and the multiplayer flaws. The excellent single-player gameplay, the solid multiplayer component, and the incredibly immersive battlefield environment make for a truly impressive game. Any action fan who is open-minded enough to look past the graphics engine will see a game that easily ranks with Rainbow Six as one of the year\'s best ""alternative shooters.""

830,Shattered Light,"[""A better name for Catware's role-playing game Shattered Light would be Diablo Lite. What has been removed from Blizzard's now-classic dungeon romp? Three things: a polished interface, attractive graphics, and fun."", 'Shattered Light is essentially an RPG adventure builder with a sample quest included. The packaged campaign tells the story of Delos, a world ""not unlike our own"" until someone rather stupidly tries to ""capture the primal power of the universe."" The upshot of this quite frankly insane attempt to ""capture the primal power of the universe"" is that Delos becomes less like our world and more like Middle Earth. Some inhabitants become much more magical, while others become one of over a hundred monsters such as dragons and unicorns. As a result of all the newfound fantastical wizardry, medieval weapon stores are opened, dungeons are constructed, and many people lose things then offer rewards for their retrieval. You are cast as the hero of Delos. Your duties include wandering all over the place and finding the ten gem shards needed to access the dungeon containing the Final Boss Monster of Delos, the Laria.', ""As in any standard RPG, you must first create a character. Shattered Light includes eight character types covering all the basics, with spell casters, fighters, and various combinations of the two. The character creation screen is where you'll get your first sense that you may not have purchased a triple-A title. Of the eight choices, three have the exact same palette-swapped portraits. A small detail perhaps, but indicative of Shattered Light's generic, bargain-bin atmosphere."", 'The game itself, like Diablo, plays out in real time across maps rendered in isometric perspective. The graphics are tile based, rather washed out, and not particularly mood setting or otherwise interesting. The interface is presented as a series of desktop windows. The main playfield, inventory, spell list, etc. are all separate, often overlapping, screens. Performing a standard operation, such as removing an active inventory item and replacing it with another, often involves opening up several windows and manually dragging them into viewable position. This is a tedious drill at best, and, when attempted during a time-critical situation such as combat, effectively sucks the fun right out of Shattered Light.', 'A good adventure can overcome shoddy graphics or a clunky interface with an imaginative plot and interesting gameplay. Shattered Light, unfortunately, has neither. For a game that advertises quests written by such noted fantasy authors as Robert Silverberg, Chelsea Quinn Yarbro, and P.N. Elrod, Shattered Light has virtually no task more elaborate than listening to an NPC describe his lost treasure, then fetching it for him. There is no sense of an evolving story composed of a complex chain of actions and reactions. The only thing leading you to believe that multiple authors may have written the plot is the inconsistent way in which NPCs address you. Some speak directly to you, while others have their actions narrated in the third person, perhaps by famous fantasy author Jody Lynn Nye - who knows?', ""Gamers excited by the possibility of creating their own adventures with Shattered Light's world builder will be disappointed. Although every map, monster, item, spell, and NPC can be redefined, graphics must be selected from the stock images provided with the game, and the basic goal of finding the ten gem shards cannot be altered. More importantly, no scripting language is included, severely limiting the storytelling possibilities. While the ability to tweak the stats of every game item might give the illusion of creative power, the core quest activity of item retrieval is immutable. This inability to script sophisticated event sequences outside of the standard quest structure leads inevitably to frustration for anyone hoping to create compelling scenarios."", ""The provided editing tools are also subpar. Editing screens contain lists of hundreds of items each with ten or more separate attributes, yet they cannot be sorted or searched through, making managing them needlessly cumbersome. In other places, previously defined items must be linked to other items by manually typing their cryptic identifier tags, rather than simply picking them from a list. These are just two of many examples of the editor's overall lack of polish - excusable when the tool is included as a bonus, but not when it is a game's central feature."", 'Shattered Light includes a server application that allows user-created scenarios to be experienced by up to eight people simultaneously over the Internet. The host can act as a sort of dungeon master, altering some statistics on the fly. Mutiplayer works as advertised and is stable, but the rewards of playing the game are so meager as to make this fact all but irrelevant.', ""In the early '90s, SSI released an RPG builder called Forgotten Realms: Unlimited Adventures. It secured a cult following and, although out of print, retains a community of quest creators to this day.

832,BattleTanx: Global Assault,"['In the <i>BattleTanx</i> universe, the year 2006 ushers in a nasty virus that wipes out nearly the entire female population, sending governments into a <i>Mars Needs Women</i>-style stockpiling of the remaining few. Once the craze hits a Pok&eacute;mon-level frenzy, countries begin waging the ultimate battle <i>for</i> the sexes. Nice storyline, 3DO. Luckily, the BattleTanx vehicle combat series focuses on unabashed action and only barely hints at its tacky premise, so please, read on.', ""<i>BattleTanx: Global Assault</i> retreads the well-received 1998 debut with new weapons, power-ups, and locations, and revamped graphics and effects. Gameplay is simple. Players take control of 12 different tanks, ranging from an air-gliding hover tank to super-armored monster tanks, and battle it out against computerized tanks or up to three other players in a variety of global cities. Part of the fun of the original game is the ability to destroy buildings, taken to a new level in <i>Global Assault</i> with a greater variety of destructible objects, including cars and street lamps. Power-ups and weapons abound, with cloaking abilities, turbo boosts, mines, and nuclear weapons providing devastatingly fun ways to turn enemies into big ol' twisted heaps of smoking metal."", ""The single-player game features seven different modes of play, including deathmatch and capture the flag variations. The very addictive, over-the-top fun of the debut's multiplayer mode returns with more frenzied and explosive butt-kicking. <i>--Eric Twelker</i>"", ""It's always frustrating to watch sequels make the same mistakes as their predecessors, but it happens often. Instances such as the weak camera from the original Croc showing up again in Croc 2 are surprisingly common. That said, 3DO's BattleTanx: Global Assault is remarkable because its developers clearly listened to all the complaints lodged against the first title and systematically corrected those problems in part two. While the end result isn't necessarily a flawless game, it's a title much improved over BattleTanx and far easier to recommend. <P>The premise of BattleTanx new and old was inspired by the plots from at least several apocalyptic '70s sci-fi films and novels. In this latest edition, you and your wife are safeguarding chieftains of a new civilization and have recently sired a child - a rarity in this future world, where most of the women have died due to a strange, if modestly generic plague. One of the other world leaders, a madwoman who controls most of Europe, has discovered that your son has telepathic powers (known as The Edge) similar to her own, and sets out to steal him from you before he develops fully. When her troops (they're all in tanks - everyone drives tanks in this game, just accept it) fail to kidnap him, she uses The Edge to take control of your forces, setting the three of you on the run. At that point, you pop into your trusty tank and fight the good fight once again. <P>OK, so obviously, unlike other aspects of the game, the original BattleTanx storyline wasn't criticized enough to warrant an upgrade, but enhancements do abound here. To begin with, not only are there almost twice as many levels, but they feel less cookie-cutter than before and offer more variety. You might play a few simple search-and-destroy missions back to back, but then they're followed up by one in which you have to guard a convoy or free allies from a prison. Your tank's turning ability has also been significantly upgraded. While it once took forever to bring your turret to bear on an enemy, it now shifts quickly with the treads following only shortly thereafter. The graphics? They're prettier too. <P>There are also new secondary weapons and power-ups, such as grenades, which can be thrown into fortified areas or bounced around corners to destroy heavy-gun emplacements; a plasma pulse that zooms around the screen until it finds a target; and a cloaking effect that renders you invisible after a Predator-style shimmer. And you're not the only one who gets to pick them up; you'll find the enemy tanks using them frequently, perhaps to your chagrin, but it at least adds to the game's challenge. No doubt about it though, the best weapon you have in your arsenal is The Edge, which initially only stuns opponents within close range, but then later allies them with you once your abilities have improved.  <P>The game's whole life system has changed as well. Instead of having a set number of lives, you acquire tank bucks, which are used to buy different tanks. The basic Abrams tanks cost a standard amount of money, with the beefy Goliaths running twice as much, and the small quick rides running about half the price. How you want to spend your cash is up to you. There are more tanks to choose from in the sequel as well - from the Inferno, which sports a flamethrower, to the Marksman, which equips a laser you can use to snipe from a distance. <P>The multiplayer modes were the main attraction in the first title, but they seem to have fallen behind a little bit in the sequel. With frame rates getting faster and faster in the multiplayer sections of consoles games, the slow-moving tanks no longer seem to get the thematic break they once used to get. Even the fastest vehicle in this game has nothing on a basic grunt from Quake II's multiplayer. The variety of tanks, weapons, and stages helps out a lot throughout BT2's multiplayer deathmatch variations, but you'll skip over many of them for the Battlelord stages, where you must steal your opponents' queens and return them to your base, all the while defending your own matriarch. The two-player co-op mission, where you and a friend play the main game through a split-screen perspective, is also worth noting, and serves as a great addition to the series.  <P>It's true that the BattleTanx series' gameplay is essentially just a slower version of 989's Twisted Metal, yet it possesses a more strategic bent and a certain cheesy charm that, this time, is just enough to win you over. Playing BattleTanx: Global Assault will remind you of renting SNES and Genesis games that, while not scoring any high marks for technical merit, were simply fun to play. BT2's improvements over its forerunner, combined with its multiplayer options, nudge it out of the rental category and into that of a worthwhile buy. --Joe Fielder <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

833,Crusaders of Might &amp; Magic PS,"[""Drake once lived a peaceful and happy life in his village. He never bothered anyone, and he never wanted to be a hero. Suddenly, an army of the undead, led by Necros, destroyed Drake's village. Unable to do anything, Drake left the ruins of the village and became a merchant. Several years later, while selling swords and shields, Drake gets caught in the Crusade, an uprising of noble spirits who are out to destroy Necros and his army of the undead. Take control of Drake as he joins the Crusade. Run, jump and climb through 3D environments as Drake destroys Necros's legions with swords, axes, maces, and a little magic. Will Drake survive to fight Necros, or will he try to leave the Crusade at his first opportunity? Play CRUSADERS OF MIGHT AND MAGIC and discover what happens."", ""Don't you hate it when monsters storm your village, kill your family, and leave you for dead? Well, if you own a PlayStation and don't mind a little role-playing action, you can exact revenge on those bony freaks. In 3DO's Crusaders of Might and Magic, you star as Drake, a hardened hero with a flair for magic and a penchant for butt-kicking. Suckered by the fair Celestia into ridding the land of Necros' undead legions, you'll travel back and forth across nine areas of dank forests, majestic castles, and depressing dungeons. Whether you're in the oppressive stronghold, the majestic citadel, or on glistening glaciers, you'll encounter quirky villagers, macho guards, and a near-limitless cadre of vile demons. At its core, Crusaders of Might and Magic is a 3D action role-playing game, akin to a fantasy version of Soul Reaver. As Drake, you can run, jump, climb, attack, and dole out magic like it's going out of style. Most of the time, you'll be running about swinging your weapon at enemies, acquiring items, or yapping with the locals. To even up the odds, a variety of swords, axes, maces, and other handheld attack accoutrements are at your disposal. You've also got plenty of shields, spells, and assorted healing potions to support your endeavors. As the game progresses, you'll acquire even better weapons and more spells, while continually increasing your experience and stamina levels. The monsters you face have vulnerability to or strengths againstcertain weapons and spells, further contributing to the game's lasting appeal. Survive through to the end of the crusade, and a satisfying battle with Necros awaits, provided you can defeat the sheer number of demons the last few levels throw at you. Though Necros' henchmen are no slouches in the difficulty department, the game's control system is actually the greatest learning curve that prospective players must surpass. Indeed, it is somewhat of a bear to switch weapons or items during the heat of combat, since hitting select, then X, then left or right, then select again is a pain to do hundreds of times, especially when you've got ten shields and 30 spells weighing you down. Still, it's no worse than the submenu systems of Resident Evil or Tomb Raider. If you can see past this solitary quibble, the fighting system is enjoyable, and exploration is easy enough. Furthermore, who doesn't want to go around brutalizing the undead with a weapon called Divine Justice? Visually, Crusaders of Might and Magic serves up the goods in a crisp, clean, and refined way. Corridors, dungeons, forests, and castles are all well detailed, replete with torches, tapestries, vines, and a plethora of other interior-decorating niceties. The polygonal character models are, for the most part, exceptional, with a believable level of animation. Loose-fitting clothes flap in the breeze, swords emit sparks on impact, and enemies even hunch over in pain as your fireballs of death implode their insufficient chest cavities. When you find yourself approximately 30 minutes into the game and notice the gleam off the captain's sword, you too will be at least somewhat impressed. There are minor amounts of texture-warping and clipping issues here and there, but no more than those found in Soul Reaver or Shadowman. The game's sound is also above average, delivering the type of experience that fantasy fans eat up. The music is both enchanting and varied, leaving little room for complaint. There's a decent mix of classically orchestral and New Age-style music, which adds to the game's somewhat medieval appeal. Weapon sounds are also exceptional, varying in both pitch and timbre, depending on where and what they impact. Even more impressive are the grunts, growls, and guttural utterances the Legion monsters produce - so scary that even Resident Evil fanatics will take notice. Like a cherry on top, there's also plenty of character-interaction speech, which furthers the game's intricate plot while breaking up the monotony of exploration. Admittedly, Crusaders of Might and Magic isn't the best role-playing game nor the best 3D adventure title. However, it represents an ample merger of the two genres, aiming to please those who desire both plot and variety in their dungeon adventures. While those burned out on games such as Tomb Raider, Soul Reaver, and Shadow Man may want to steer clear, those looking for an engrossing RPG experience and a good 3D adventure may want to check out Crusaders of Might and Magic.  [Editor's Note: Contrary to what you may have heard out there on the Web, the final version of Crusaders of Might and Magic is not a buggy, crash-laden piece of software. We played through the game from beginning to end, and it didn't crash once.]<i>--Frank Provo</i>--<i>Copyright  1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

834,Army Men Sarge's Heroes,"[""Sherman was right: war <i>is</i> hell. Just ask the green  plastic toy soldiers in <i>Army Men Sarge's Heroes</i>. Day after day,  they face destruction from an arsenal of dastardly weapons, ranging  from rays concentrated by a magnifying glass, explosive skyrockets,  spray cans, and the ultimate weapon--the garbage disposal."", 'In this version of the popular game series, players lead Sarge through  15 missions filled with dangerous objectives, ultimately attempting to  thwart General Plastro\'s ghastly plans with his newly acquired weapons  of mass destruction. Players can experience the action from ""our  world,"" fighting through seven levels set in a suburban home\'s living  room, kitchen, bathroom, and backyard garden. To get closer to the  action, players can jump into the frontline in the ""plastic world,"" a  land of mountainous terrain, arctic wastelands, forests, and towns. Six  multiplayer missions and a family mode allow players to recruit  freedom-fighting friends of all ranks.', ""The first game in 3DO's Army Men series for the console systems, Army Men 3D for the PlayStation, lacked a great deal of spit and polish but had enough going deep down to make you hope for a sequel, albeit one that was much improved. That sequel, Army Men: Sarge's Heroes, came out for the Nintendo 64 last year and has now arrived for the PlayStation, but not much, if anything, has been improved upon, and it contains even more problems. You once again take the role of Sarge, a soldier on the Green side of a world full of plastic army men. The Green are in a war against the Tan forces, who have recently begun importing terrible weapons from our own world, such as magnifying glasses, which they use to melt your men down to plastic puddles. Your mission is to gather your troops, a la John Belushi in The Blues Brothers, to create a unit capable of stopping them. Your arsenal is made up of weapons from Army Men 3D, such as a machine gun, a flamethrower, and grenades, with new additions like a sniper rifle and mines. The game camera in Army Men 3D's single-player mode was near perfect because it stuck right behind your back, but in Sarge's Heroes for the N64, it floated behind you, and when your character turned, it took a few seconds to catch up. You'd sneak around the corner of a barracks and confront an enemy, who would then fire on you immediately, only he wouldn't come into view for a few seconds. Luckily, the camera in the PlayStation version of AM:SA stays put right behind you, although it also zooms into the sky for dramatic effect at times. Another fix is that it's now very easy to strafe in the game - not having this option was one of the main complaints about the original Army Men 3D. Also, expected differences between the PlayStation and N64 versions, such as improved sound and CG movies between levels, are of course present.  You probably won't need to get close to too many troops though, since the autotargeting is set so you can pick off enemies situated in towers simply by firing in their general direction. That was in place in Army Men 3D, but you weren't really able to get away with just running around blasting opposing forces because you'd get eaten up by machine-gun fire. Now, while enemies still fall with one or two shots, your character is a lot tougher, and health-restoring power-ups can be found all over the place. One pitfall that you'll have to worry about though is that you'll stumble upon an odd patch of land where the collision detection has decided to go wonky, and while you are trying to unstick yourself, you might get mowed down by a machine gunner. This is a strange but real concern. Somehow the graphics in Army Men: Sarge's Heroes for the PlayStation have turned out worse than in the original game. Pop-up and fog are plentiful, the textures are repeated often, and the world generally looks very sparse and bland. Instances where you'll end up floating in midair or observe enemies walking through buildings are frequent. The sound effects are also similarly bad. Explosions, weapon fire, and your character's Duke Nukem-esque chatter all sound muffled, and the military-themed music is tinny. The multiplayer mode has been trimmed back to two players from the N64's four, taking any fun out of it. .  Those hoping for a more polished sequel to Army Men 3D will be disappointed to hear that this title is even more shoddily produced than the original and that it retains little of its embarrassing charm. Within minutes of playing Army Men: Sarge's Heroes, you will be surprised at what Sony will approve for final release these days.<i>--Joe Fielder</i>--<i>Copyright  1998 GameSpot Inc.

You want to lay rubber all over Kenny\'s innocent little face. <P>Well, wait no more (OK, maybe a bit longer). This holiday season, you and your friends can put Sega\'s Dreamcast to shame with the [cough] best animation seen yet in a racer. Developed for the PC, the PlayStation, and the Nintendo 64, South Park Rally will take on Need for Speed 3 and Gran Turismo 2 as theracing game to play with buddies. Gamers get to race over and around (and likely through) the various South Park institutions, which fans of the show will instantly recognize. You can select more than twelve characters for a joyride through downtown South Park or the South Park forest, and each character has a vehicle that matches the driver\'s personality. Cartman whips around the competition in a 4x4 Sport Utility Vehicle; Grandpa defies geriatric physics in a rocket-propelled wheelchair; Chef dashes about in an ugly wood-paneled station wagon; Officer Barbrady jaunts around the town in the official South Park police cruiser; and Stan screams past opponents in his father\'s stolen hot rod.  <P>Early word from Tantalus Software indicates that South Park Rally is, naturally, based more on character interaction than on pure racing. When fighting, players can hurl weapons like chocolate salty balls at their opponents, or unleash the devastating Mexican Staring Frog. Acclaim\'s product manager Tom Bass won\'t release much information, but he did say that many of the multiplayer levels are cooperative, and that coordinated efforts will be necessary to see players through. He also added that the traditional notion of what a racing game is has been overlooked because South Park Rally is going for laughs. The title will feature levels based on traditional South Park festivities, such as Christmas and the infamous Cow Days. <P>Matt Stone, Trey Parker, and Isaac Hayes have selflessly volunteered to record original sound bites for the new title so that all the more players will find themselves being drawn into the colorful, carefree world that is South Park. As in South Park: Chef\'s Luv Shack, game boxes will display labels indicating the rather ""irreverent"" nature of Acclaim\'s latest production. Whether this will diminish or boost sales is anyone\'s guess. A new kart game is just what the [cough] dying console racing genre needs, and if any 1990s franchise can bring in the disposable dough of video-game fans around the world, it\'s South Park. --Doug Trueman <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

843,Driver - PC,"[""GT Interactive's new game, <i>Driver</i>, puts gamers right into the middle of the action and squarely behind the wheel of the most wanted getaway car. Assuming the identity of an undercover cop named Tanner, players sell their services as drivers-for-hire to the highest bidder in order to infiltrate a powerful crime ring spanning four of the nation's largest cities--New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Miami. <i>Driver</i> delivers the clutch-your-seats, adrenaline-charged action of a Hollywood-style car chase, propelling players along a high-speed, all-out thrill ride. <i>Driver's</i> true-to-life modeling of automobile physics, ultra-realistic environments, cutting-edge graphics, and revolutionary replay mode allow users to experience an elaborate, realistic interactive driving experience."", ""Like many console-to-PC ports, Driver suffers from being translated verbatim and taking little advantage of the more powerful PC platform. However, Driver's core game design is so strikingly original and fun that it can be enjoyed without embellishment. <P> As its name implies, Driver is a game about driving - at dangerous speeds through densely populated city streets. The game was designed by the makers of the Destruction Derby series and casts you as an undercover 1970s policeman motoring your way into the heart of mob territory through the criminal application of your cop-honed driving skills. Rather than focussing on racing as in Microsoft's recent city-cruising game Midtown Madness, Driver is all about the interactive re-creation of classic car-chase movies like Bullitt and Freebie and the Bean. Pursuit, evasion, survival, and the judicious implementation of all-out vehicular mayhem compose the core of the action. <P> Most car games that dispense with racing replace it with predictable hood-mounted gunplay. Not so with Driver: You pilot an array of big bazooka-less American muscle cars that belch exhaust and run great on regular gas - the most dangerous thing shooting out of these wheeled hellhounds is an illegal mix of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon pollutants. To succeed in Driver, you must master the art of driving like a maniac with precision and control. <P> Those skills are developed in Driver's main game, a mission-based trek through the streets of Miami, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York. The missions are presented as job offers left on an answering machine in a three-dimensional rendering of your character's sleazy apartment, which also acts as the in-game option screen. Your car has two basic attributes: damage and felony. Damage is simply a reverse life bar - when it reaches its upper limit, the car is trashed and the mission ends in failure. Felony is a measurement of police interest in your current activities. It increases if any police cruiser witnesses your vehicle operating illegally. As it rises, the cops will begin to actively pursue you, eventually taking such drastic measures as establishing roadblocks and calling in reinforcements. This gauge introduces a rather original play concept: To win, you must sometimes drive within the limits of the law. Crawling through a busy intersection at a soul-deadening speed while making a rare appearance on the correct side of the road and hoping to God the cop stopped at the light doesn't notice the black smoke pouring out of your crumpled hood is an exciting experience unique to Driver. <P> You'll also enjoy discovering the many creative ways in which Reflections has used the relatively simple components of its gameworld to concoct a wide variety of interesting scenarios. The missions range from timed trips across town, aggressive pursuits of other vehicles, and eluding the fuzz, to unusual and surprising tasks such as scaring the hell out of an informant by taking him on a wild ride, and sending a message to another gang by smashing through the plate-glass windows of its legitimate businesses. Saving the game is only permitted between missions, but it's a testament to the game's success that this fact never becomes a liability. Playing Driver is such great fun and the levels are designed with enough common-sense brevity that restarting a mission almost never becomes frustrating. Car physics are definitely more arcade-like than realistic, but they make for a thrilling mix of impossible, hubcap-flinging turns and stomach-dropping jumps, especially when careening through the streets of San Francisco. <P> Once you've completed the game's nearly 50 missions, you can keep yourself occupied with Driver's skills-testing bonus games. Seven are included, the best being survival, in which you must escape a pack of kamikaze police cruisers for as long as possible. Even with an entire city to drive through, the cops are incredibly difficult to elude. But for the average minute, or the extraordinary two minutes, that it takes them to capture you, it's a real blast. Better yet, true to Driver's cinematic roots, a full replay facility is available, complete with a wide variety of camera placement features. <P> Although undeniably enjoyable, Driver isn't without noticeable flaws. The graphics are good but not up to the standard set by Midtown Madness. The cities are somewhat blocky, and the building textures are often blurry and repetitive. The soundtrack is forgettable, generic '70s funk, and the in-game movies are pretty awful. Driver's mission-loading times, though not unbearable, actually seem to be longer than on the console version. Restarting a mission on the PlayStation was an instantaneous process, but on the PC, the level must be reloaded from scratch. Finally, aside from some graphical enhancements, nothing significant has been added to the game since its console debut.

The minigames are extremely basic, some taking on elements of classic arcade games like Asteroids, Warlords, Super Sprint, Tapper, and Kickman. Others are oriented toward button mashing. After seeing each of the minigames once, you'll probably wish there were a way to disable them altogether. The trivia and the game's warped sense of humor are the main draws here, and the minigames really take away from the overall presentation. Graphically, the game looks just as you would expect it to.

858,Nam - PC,"['Set in the middle of the Vietnam War, <i>Nam</i> surrounds you with the intensity and paranoia of jungle warfare. Avoid the firefights, ambushes, booby traps, snipers, air strikes, and anti-personnel mines as you make your way through battle.', 'Here\'s a puzzler for all you action gamers: Why would someone create a first-person shooter based on a war in which the biggest obstacle was trying to see who was shooting at you? The game in question is NAM, which strives to deliver the fun and intensity of a first-person action game and the realism of a simulation - and because of that indecision it ultimately fails on both counts. GT Interactive has been touting the fact that the game was ""created with the developer of the Doom conversion for the Marine Corps,"" but that only means that if that conversion is like this game, then it\'s not very fun for us civilians to play. <P> NAM puts you in the boots of Alan ""the Bear"" Westmoreland (couldn\'t these guys have come up with something more original than the last name of the top US general in Vietnam?), a Marine Corps sergeant who has the handy ability to absorb insane amounts of bullets and recuperate to full strength instantaneously by grabbing little bags with Red Cross emblems on them. The reason for the Bear\'s Duke Nukem-like powers? The CIA\'s dosed him up with - and I quote from the manual - ""an experimental serum that is a healing agent, pain killer, and stimulant all rolled into one bad-ass cocktail."" Wow - if they\'d given this stuff to every grunt in Vietnam, Hanoi would probably look like Las Vegas by now. <P> The real reason behind the Bear\'s superhuman abilities, though, is much simpler: NAM was made using the Build engine (as in Duke Nukem 3D, Redneck Rampage, Shadow Warrior, Blood, etc.), and about all that\'s been done for the sake of ""realism"" has been to make the enemies almost invisible in the dense jungle undergrowth and to limit the amount of ammo for heavy weapons like the M72 antitank rocket launcher and the M79 grenade launcher. Even there, the designers add a video game touch: Both weapons have been enhanced so they\'ll home in on an enemy soldier, which actually is a drawback if you\'re trying to hit a spot between two foes in order to take them both out with one hit. <P> So what you get is a single guy squaring off against 60 or 70 enemies per level - it\'s like Rambo starring in Duke Nukem or Redneck Rampage, but with the handicap of limited ammo for his heavy-duty weapons. Because the Build engine does a pretty crappy job of rendering leaves and brush, you wind up staring at a bunch of pixels trying to spot the flash from a gun barrel as you see your life meter gradually shrink to nothingness. That might reflect how tough it was to see VC or NVA soldiers, but it doesn\'t add up to very much fun. The Build engine was made for running and gunning, not crawling and sniping - but that\'s what it\'s being used for here. <P> What\'s more disappointing is that NAM doesn\'t even manage to incorporate the few advances that have been made to the Build engine over the years. Feel like driving that tank that\'s parked beside you at the start of a mission? You could, if NAM were designed by 3D Realms (Shadow Warrior) or Xatrix (Redneck Rampage Rides Again), both of which let you drive vehicles; instead, all you can do is look at it longingly and be thankful for the machine-gun fire it\'s spitting out. And NAM runs agonizingly slow compared with other games using the Build engine - it\'s probably because of all the computing muscle required to render the trees and leaves, but that doesn\'t change the fact that the animation is amazingly choppy at 640x480 even on the recommended system (Pentium 133). <P> NAM strives to re-create the action in NAM by letting you call in artillery and air support, but it bears little resemblance to the real thing. Request an air strike, and before you can say ""Hanoi Hilton"" you\'ll see napalm bursts dotting the landscape in front of you. You also get to control AI marines on several missions, but by the time you maneuver in front of them and issue an order, it\'s likely that either you or they will wind up lying face down in the pixelated jungle breathing your last breath. <P> NAM features the usual multiplayer options of any game using the Build engine, but because it\'s not officially supported on a gaming network, the only way to find an opponent is to head to the Internet Gaming Zone or HEAT and search for someone who owns the game. Given how little fun is to be had in the game\'s single-player mode, though, the chances aren\'t too good that you\'ll be running into a lot of people eager to play with you. <P> And that\'s actually something of a shame. Besides CTF and gruntmatch games, NAM allows you to play in fireteam mode (sort of like Team Fortress for Quake), in which each player can choose a different role - sniper, medic, machine gunner, and so on - so that you have to work as a team to win the mission (once your character dies, you\'re out until the mission\'s over). There\'s also an option to play gruntmatch games against AI opponents, but it\'s little more than a joke: These guys must have been drinking that ""badass cocktail"" that Bear was knocking down, because they\'re almost impossible to kill - they move at the speed of light and tend to hang out at the spots where you rematerialize after dying (damn campers!). <P> But make no mistake: No matter what the box copy says about ""realistically bringing the true experience of the Vietnam War to life,"" this is a video game trying to pass itself off as an accurate and realistic simulation. Is it a good first-person shoot-em-up? No. Is it a good simulation? No. Should you buy it? No. <P> That is all. Dismissed. <I>--Chris Gregson</I> <BR><I>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

Journey through seven environments, including an opulent Persian palace, an exciting air ship, and Tibetan cliffs.', ""If everything about Prince of Persia 3D were bad, it wouldn't be nearly as frustrating as it is. If the game were terrible or even mediocre, it would be easy to file away with all other such games that come out month after month. But there is much to like about Prince of Persia 3D, and certain aspects of it are especially excellent. Yet this third outing for Jordan Mechner's swashbuckling hero has two tragic flaws, and these problems are so overwhelming that the good parts seem wasted."", 'The previous two Prince of Persia games, the first from 1989 and its sequel The Shadow and the Flame from 1993, were both side-scrolling action games. In them, you controlled the prince as he climbed ledges, fought guards, and jumped over and crawled under traps, all in search of his beloved and imprisoned fiance. Prince of Persia 3D follows this formula exactly, only this time the game is in 3D, and the prince and his princess are married. But once again, the prince has been imprisoned and left for dead, and he must escape the clutches of the villain and rescue his fair maiden.', ""That Prince of Persia 3D is essentially a three-dimensional version of its predecessors is no criticism. In fact, the trap-jumping, guard-fighting gameplay of the original translates nicely to 3D, and the best part of the game is how effectively it utilizes these elements. Only a handful of games have so successfully created the feeling that you are capable of such daring feats. During the course of the game, you'll find yourself swinging from ropes across wide chasms, leaping off high ledges to slide down rising drawbridges, and other exciting stunts."", ""The excellent level design in Prince of Persia 3D makes such stunts commonplace. The game is well paced; it has just enough enemies so combat doesn't get tedious, enough exciting moments to make you want to keep playing, and enough puzzles to keep things interesting in between. The levels also look quite stunning and are filled with big, exotic architecture and wondrous gadgets and machinery."", ""But while the levels themselves look great, the characters that populate them don't. That's not to say they look bad (except in the cutscenes, in which the disproportional bodies and strange faces of the characters can look downright ugly), but they don't look particularly special either. The motion-captured animation looks great, except when the prince runs up stairs or ramps, at which point he looks like an old man who just doesn't have it in him anymore. Then again, it's been ten years since he first took to adventuring, so perhaps we should give him a break."", ""The inconsistent visuals would be easier to ignore if the game didn't have more serious problems. The game's worst flaw is its sluggish and unresponsive control. Turning the prince while running feels like trying to steer an 18-wheeler. He turns wide, which makes running around corners a chore. And the game often won't respond to two commands at once, so that actions such as drawing your weapon or simply jumping while running are far more difficult than they should be."", ""The perspective is almost as problematic. The camera stays at a fixed point behind the prince, and only occasionally adjusts itself to clear objects and obstructions. You can control the camera Tomb Raider-style if you stand still and manipulate it manually. But that doesn't help when your back is against a wall and you're trying to make a difficult jump while the camera is showing you in close-up profile. Such situations are all too common in Prince of Persia 3D."", ""During combat, the camera angle is less of an issue because the perspective switches to a side view when your weapon is drawn, and while this feature is helpful, it too produces its share of annoyances. You can't turn while your weapon is drawn, which makes lining up with an enemy difficult. Thankfully, enemies will run up and get in position for a fight, but often you'll just start swinging wildly while they bash away at you. Then again, this problem goes both ways; your enemies will just as often not be able to hit you while you whack away at them with impunity."", 'Prince of Persia 3D would have been amazing had it been more refined in certain specific areas. The quality of the levels will more than likely make you want to keep playing despite its flaws, but these flaws will be a constant source of dismay for anyone who just wants to enjoy jumping and slashing around in the otherwise well designed world. <i>--Ron Dulin</i> <br />--<i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc.

Unfortunately, South Park Rally, while easily the best of the South Park games, continues this losing streak with poor control and graphics. The story, as if this game really needs one, is that the good townsfolk of South Park commemorate every holiday by holding a go-cart event. These events range from simple races to events where one racer needs to hold on to an item for a certain length of time. For instance, on Valentine's Day everyone assembles at Big Gay Al's place to shoot one another with cupid arrows. The catch is that there's only one bow, making it a fight for control of the bow while trying not to get shot. Once you get the bow, you must get enough distance between yourself and the other drivers so you can get off a few shots without losing it. This setup makes the gameplay fast paced and even frantic at times. To help you fend off or prevent the other racers from passing you, the levels are filled with an arsenal of offensive and defensive objects. There are dogs, cats, and alien lasers, all of which can stall your opposition for a brief period of time. There are also little Terrance and Phillip boxes filled with gas, giving you a momentary speed boost. You can even pick up Mr. Hanky, who patrols around your vehicle, keeping you free from harm for a limited time.  The gameplay, while fairly fun, is hampered by poor control and physics that make the game hard to play. The biggest problem with the control is the vehicles' turning speed. If you get yourself in a tight situation where competitors are coming right at you, you might as well just take it head-on, since turning around takes forever. As does getting your vehicle back on its wheels after it flips, which happens a lot since the car physics are way too floaty, resulting in vehicles bouncing all over the place. Graphically, South Park Rally looks downright sloppy. The one exception is that all of the characters and their vehicles look pretty decent. The levels and objects on the levels, however, look poor and washed out. A copious amount of pop-up rounds out the depressing graphical presentation. The raunchy quips from the game's characters are funny at first, but they quickly become tiresome. In the end, South Park Rally's charm, even for the biggest South Park fan, wears thin fairly quickly - especially when compared with Crash Team Racing, a similar, yet nearly infinitely more entertaining PlayStation game. South Park fans may want to rent this game, but it's far too limited to consider for purchase.<i>--Ryan Mac Donald</i>--<i>Copyright  1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

And when it comes to battle, you won't be alone--cooperative and head-to-head multiplayer support will inspire you to hone your survival skills."", ""Of all the computer games inspired by Games Workshop's Warhammer 40,000 tabletop science-fiction wargame, Rites of War is the first to place the fanatical Imperium of Man in a peripheral role. Suddenly the space marines are the enemy, and the game centers on the proud and mighty Eldar, a fallen race still clinging to life thanks to remarkable technology and limitless courage. Fans of the source material will no doubt appreciate the opportunity posed by Rites of War to take on the Imperium with the Eldar's alien weapons and will be further pleased to learn that they'll face the Tyranid as well, who haven't shown their ugly faces on the computer screen since Space Hulk. Together, these three races are a fascinating bunch, so much so that they clearly influenced their counterparts in Blizzard's wildly popular real-time strategy game Starcraft. Even so, they still can't save Rites of War from feeling like the typical and underwhelming turn-based strategy game that it is."", ""The Eldar may be a mysterious race indeed, but what's especially mysterious about Rites of War is why its system requirements are so steep. The fact is, Rites of War looks like a very old game, largely because it runs on the two-year-old Panzer General II graphics engine, which arguably didn't even look that great for its time. Yet while mediocre graphics are acceptable in the turn-based strategy genre, poor performance is not. You'd think smooth, fast gameplay would be the least a developer could offer, when having to work with an old graphics engine. But you can expect sluggish performance from Rites of War even if you exceed its preposterously high minimum requirements."", ""If you can get it running, you'll find that Rites of War plays more like a wargame and not so much like its source material. Most missions have you moving around 15 units one by one over a hex-based map in an effort to defeat your enemies or claim their territory. The majority of these units can only attack adjacent hexes, at which point the game compares unit stats for initiative, strength, toughness, and so forth to resolve the combat. You'll need a variety of units to succeed; tactical units are useful in any situation but are vulnerable to artillery. Artillery can soften up most any target from long range, although assault units can easily destroy them or most anything else if they can get close enough. Devastator units are especially important, and while slow, their powerful attacks can provide cover fire for their allies. Scouts can see far ahead and attack without fear of retaliation, catching their foes by surprise. You'll also deploy aerial units, war machines, and psykers with their devastating psychic powers. True to its source, Rites of War feels well balanced, and all three of its sides play differently yet are similarly powerful. It's an interesting and effective variation on the Warhammer 40,000 rules, although its combat is regrettably far less visceral than the preceding Warhammer 40,000 strategy games Chaos Gate and Final Liberation."", ""Part of the reason is Rites of War just doesn't look or sound very good. Though the game is colorful, and its maps are fairly detailed and cleanly rendered, the unit graphics themselves look sloppy and animate so poorly that you'll wonder whether it's your computer rather than the game that's at fault. If you're very familiar with the pewter Warhammer 40,000 miniatures that the six-dozen-odd units in Rites of War are taken from, then you'll be able to distinguish the game's renderings of a Howling Banshee Exarch from a Dire Avenger without too much trouble. But if you aren't so experienced with the source material, the game's units will utterly fail to convey the detail and charisma that helped make the tabletop wargame so popular. The units aren't shown to scale, either - a fact that will put your ability to suspend disbelief to a serious test. Even behemoths such as the Tyranid Carnifex are reduced to the size of everything else. Consequently, the battles in Rites of War are abstracted so much that you'll need to work hard to convince yourself that some important battle is raging, even more so than you would playing the original game on a table with metal figurines."", ""Rites of War includes a linear campaign of two dozen missions, each of whose scenarios are introduced through a rather strikingly well-acted speech from your commanding officer, the Farseer. Unfortunately, aside from the Farseer's impassioned diatribes against the Eldar's enemies, the campaign is otherwise fairly straightforward, with few twists within the missions themselves and little cohesion between missions. The real incentive to keep playing is that your units gain experience as they fight, becoming noticeably more powerful as they do so. Most Eldar units are promoted to Exarch status once they become sufficiently experienced, turning the once-vulnerable warriors into seemingly invincible warlords."", ""While the experience system is mostly well implemented, it does have certain problems. For one thing, Exarch units are so astonishingly powerful that a lot of the game's strategy is lost once you've amassed a few of them. All but the deadliest artillery fire and most vicious melee attacks are completely shrugged aside, and an Exarch's wounds can be instantly healed by resting for a turn. You'll quickly realize how overpowered these units are and thus why many of the later missions in the game enforce a turn limit, demanding that you accomplish your goal hastily. Furthermore, once your units have attained maximum experience, all of a sudden you've lost that incentive to keep on going with them. And, provided you can keep them alive, your units will max out about two-thirds of the way through the game, making the last portion seem stale. Meanwhile, purchasing new units at this late stage in the campaign is pointless since they'll be nothing more than fodder to the experienced enemy, and will perish long before they gain any experience of their own."", ""Even in spite of these concerns, the Rites of War campaign is fairly enjoyable, with enough variety between missions and enough challenge within them to keep you interested. Since you're limited by the number of units you can deploy in each mission, and invariably not all of your units will survive the course of the campaign, there's even some incentive to play the campaign a second time to try things differently and maybe at a higher difficulty setting. Otherwise, you can play around a dozen stand-alone scenarios against the computer or against up to three other people, and Rites of War also includes an editor that lets you modify starting and victory conditions and such, without actually letting you modify the physical appearance of the available maps. And because the game contains dozens of Eldar, Imperial, and Tyranid units, Rites of War can keep you busy for a good while."", ""As you play, you'll realize that the ultimate purpose of translating Warhammer 40,000 to the computer is at least twofold: The first is to eliminate the time-consuming hassle of physically playing a tabletop wargame. And the second purpose, far more difficult to accomplish, is to express the fiction more vividly through the computer game medium than is feasible on a kitchen table. Rites of War fails in this respect, which is unfortunate since its setup is so inspiring. And because the tabletop game's context is so rich, and because, at its heart, Rites of War proves to be fairly enjoyable if you can get past all its many rough edges, the game finally comes across as a missed opportunity to show off Warhammer 40,000 in all its glory. <i>--Greg Kasavin</i> <br />--<i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc.

876,Soldiers at War - PC,"['<i>Soldiers At War</i> is turn-based, squad-level combat with the heroism and drama of a good World War II movie. Players lead a squad of eight men through a hair-raising campaign of 18 linked scenarios. Experience D-Day and the assault on Monte Cassino. Execute commando raids and fight fierce house-to-house battles in bombed-out cities such as Anzio and Cherbourg. A flexible mission editor and 10 extra stand-alone missions, many from a German perspective, make the action virtually endless.', 'Random Games came very close to making a great game with last year\'s Wages of War. The engine, a detailed isometric view of a battlefield, showed great promise, with its Jagged Alliance meets X-COM style. A fairly clumsy interface, bugs, and a lethally slow pace conspired to ruin this promise, but the same core technology is now back and largely fixed in SSI\'s Soldiers at War. <P> Think ""X-COM in World War II"" and you have a general idea of what Soldiers at War offers. The perspective on the battlefield is a finely detailed god\'s-eye view of your grunts as they shoot, stab, and explode their way through a series of WWII missions ranging from Sicily to Normandy. All battles cover the European theater in small maps and can be played either in a campaign or single missions. The benefit of the campaign is that you can carry your already-equipped squad from mission to mission and rack up kills. Units gain rank and medals over campaigns, thereby earning more action points. <P> Each mission has specific goals, and action covers street fighting, building-to-building combat, assault, defense, and special ops. You may, for instance, have to find a map or rescue a trapped unit. Action begins with selection of a squad from a large roster of soldiers, each with varying skills. Some are better shots, while others are tougher, and so on. The unit selection screen is a weak link, since you need to bring up a dossier on each soldier to see its ratings, instead of being able to tell at a glance or scroll through them all. After a squad is formed, it is equipped with a wide array of weapons, including several types of guns, flamethrowers, grenades, knives, and explosives. Medikits, radios, minesweepers, and other tools are also available. <P> Units move and perform actions in turns, with enemy actions either shown (if they are in your line of sight) or obscured (if not). Units can kneel, crawl, walk, run, shoot, throw grenades, set explosives, reload their weapons, take over tanks, and generally do just about anything by expending combat points. The use of tanks is a bit off in the game: You can hop inside and fire the gun, but you can\'t drive them around. Plus, not all tanks can be used, which is disconcerting. <P> Interaction with your soldiers has its strong and weak points. A simple pop-up menu gives you access to all commands, but there is minimal keyboard support. I would much rather play this game without the mouse, but only facing and a few minor interface commands have hotkeys. More annoying is the separate status menu, which obscures almost half of the screen when open. It is unnecessarily bulky and doesn\'t even have the benefit of including most commands. While this sliding screen does eliminate the need for a framework interface, allowing the game to run full screen, it could have been made more useful. <P> As a value, Soldiers at War has some hits and misses. The campaign game is too short at 15 missions, and though some extra scenarios and multiplayer-specific maps are included, it just doesn\'t seem like enough. This is more than balanced by SSI\'s continued release of missions free on its web site, as well as by the custom mission editor. The editor enables the creation of custom maps and scenarios, and while the interface is a little clumsy and performance flaky (I experienced some palette shifts and crashes), it is a potent tool for extending game life. Four-player Internet multiplay also helps. A bug that prevented the Bulge mission from ending has been fixed in the current patch. <P> This isn\'t a realistic WWII tactical sim like Close Combat or Steel Panthers. It\'s more like a World War II movie, with plenty of dramatic sets and missions (think Aldo Raye in Battle Cry). The combat model will not appeal to tactical wargamers at all, since it is grossly simplified. This doesn\'t affect the fun factor, however, which is extremely high. Random Games is slowly realizing the flaws in its initial Wages of War design. A more streamlined interface and better keyboard support are still in order, as are faster pacing and larger maps. We can hope Random Games will include some of these refinements in the Warhammer game it\'s making with the same engine. (And ditch the tacky Clutch Cargo commander intros.) <P> If you\'re not looking for a time-intensive, stat-heavy WWII experience, then Soldiers at War is definitely worth a spin. It\'s attractive, entertaining, and challenging, and while it may lack the depth of Jagged Alliance, it is at least as satisfying as the tactical mode of X-COM. <i>--T.

879,Goemon's Great Adventure,"['N64 Game Cartridge.', ""Konami's Goemon is back, and this time he's returned to his 2D side-scrolling roots. Goemon's Great Adventure is more of a Tomba-styled side-scroller that marries classic platform action with minor role-playing elements. While the game seems a little quirky and very Japanese, traditional side-scrolling-platform game fans will undoubtedly enjoy this Goemon. <P>The premise is that the all-knowing ancient has built a machine that brings people from the past into the present. Unfortunately, this invention is stolen by a thief who uses it to unleash a torrent of ghosts and goblins on the unknowing world, leaving it up to Goemon and his crew to retrieve the machine and put a stop to the bad spirits. <P>You can select two characters at the game's outset. Goemon, Ebisumaru, and two more characters become playable farther in. The first character you'll meet up with is a male ninja by the name of Sasuke, while the second is a female ninja named Yae, who can transform into a mermaid. Each character has his own type of striking weapon, projectile, and special attack.  <P>The gameplay mostly consists of traditional 2D run-to-the right/hit-the-enemy/platform-jumping action. Once you complete a level, you can progress to the next one, although to gain access to the final level in each stage you must have enough entry passes, which you gain by beating levels and completing side quests. The characters in the various towns you come across will set you on the side quests, which are often made up of simple tasks like going back to the level you just cleared and finding a few items before the timer runs out. The towns also let you swap characters, visit a general store to replenish supplies, check into an inn where you can rest, or see a fortune-teller from whom you can obtain secret info. The towns are filled with people who have something to tell you - most of what they say is inconsequential, but some shed light on the game story.  <P>One of the best parts of the game is its two-player cooperative-play mode. You can play the game with two people on the screen at the same time. More experienced players can actually help out others by piggybacking them through the course of the more difficult jump stages. When piggybacking, the player who isn't jumping and controlling the action gets to shoot projectiles. <P>Some of the game's bosses are incredibly easy to beat but look rather impressive. In fact, in the final level of a stage, Goemon's Great Adventure transforms into a first-person giant-robot fighting game. You can shoot, punch, kick, and block the enemy robot's attack. When the action gets too hot, you can tag out with another robot; when playing a two-player game the second player controls this robot.  <P>In the end, Goemon's Great Adventure isn't a visually stunning game that will wow anyone, but it is incredibly fun. Goemon fans will particularly like the characters and story, and platform game aficionados will just plain enjoy it. --Ryan Mac Donald <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

882,Flanker 2.0 - PC,"['The 2.0 version of <i>Flanker</i> builds on the technical excellence of the original game by adding spectacular new 3-D graphics and sound effects. Choose a plane--the Su-33 Flanker or the Su-27 Flanker--and take off from a naval carrier or from your land base in this ultrarealistic flight simulator and combat game.', ""The original Su-27 Flanker was released in 1995 and was almost immediately recognized as having one of the most outstanding and realistic flight models to date. While the game was repackaged in 1997 with all the accumulated patches and a mission disc, Flanker fans have never seen an update to the graphics engine. The Flanker series always had the advantage of running well on lower-end machines, providing an uncompromising flight model without compromising your wallet. But with the arrival of Flanker 2.0, this circumspect approach to system requirements has been jettisoned in favor of more eye-catching graphics. Was it a fair trade? For the most part, yes. <P>Like its predecessors, Flanker 2.0 quite obviously models the Su-27 Flanker (and its naval variant, the Su-33). Just like previous versions, Flanker 2.0 is not a sim for the occasional flier. It is incredibly detailed and will seem daunting at first, even to reasonably experienced sim fans. For cautious players or those without previous Flanker experience, there is an excellent set of tutorial missions that covers every meaningful aspect of the aircraft in some way. Nevertheless, it will take you many hours to become proficient at this game. <P>The first thing veteran Flanker pilots will notice is that the controls are similar enough to the original Flanker, such that they can quickly get into the game. There is also a wonderful joystick configuration tool in the setup options that allows for very flexible joystick customization even if you don't have a programmable controller. The in-game cockpit lacks a 2D view, but the 3D view is easily readable and quite functional. The only problem is that while the HUD can be toggled to display in English, the cockpit instrumentation apparently cannot, despite the manual's assertion to the contrary. <P>Discussing the accuracy of flight models seems presumptuous coming from a reviewer whose real-world supersonic jet experience is limited to one ride on the Concorde. That said, Flanker 2.0 feels as tough and realistic as its predecessor. One way this realism comes across is that the plane feels quite sluggish to the novice, yet the twin engines pack a lot of punch and can move the plane remarkably nimbly if the pilot knows how. Weapons are also difficult to judge, but Flanker 2.0's weapons model is more realistic than most other sims - perhaps too realistic, because SAMs are incredibly hard to defeat, and their kill ratio seems unusually high. This adds to the difficulty level of the game and can be very frustrating. One reason might be that SAM-tracking radar can maintain a lock even through mountains, which is clearly a bug. <P>One of Flanker 2.0's most attractive features is that it lets you fly the naval variant, the Su-33, which means operating off an aircraft carrier. While carrier operations basically consist of takeoffs and landings, they can be challenging. As with all things in Flanker 2.0, practice improves performance, and in addition to the tutorial missions, the game includes an adequately comprehensive manual that will help you overcome such challenges. -- <i>Bruce Geryk</i> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

884,Suikoden II,"['GREAT condition, includes jewel case and manual', ""Because the original Suikoden was one of the first PlayStation RPGs to grace the US shores, it garnered more attention than it deserved. Despite being a respectable enough RPG, Suikoden was a relatively shallow, quick-play RPG that was light on content and heavy on combat. Suikoden II addresses a number of the problems of the original Suikoden, and although it feels somewhat rehashed, it still holds its own nicely in today's cutthroat RPG market."", ""Suikoden II takes place several years after the first game's revolution, a time when the evil Highland empire is terrorizing the innocent, burning their villages by the handful to satisfy the bloodlust of the maniacal Prince Luca Blight. You hop into the medieval-styled britches of an idealistic young imperial rebel who is out to right the wrongs of the world. To help you defeat the evil prince, you'll have a bit of ancient magic and an army of friends. Sound familiar? Suikoden II's story mirrors that of many other RPGs, but it adds a few twists all its own for good measure. While RPG purists were disappointed by the lack of development of the first game's myriad characters, Suikoden II focuses fairly heavily on character development, preventing party members from turning into mere power-up satellites. The game still retains the quest to collect the 108 stars of destiny from the first game, but many of the characters serve more use than, say, welcoming the player to Toran Castle. The game's sense of scope is impressive, encompassing a huge world war and letting players build and staff their own castle."", ""Basic gameplay is very similar to that of the first game - your party can hold up to six of the game's many characters, each of whom has his own attacks, spells, etc. One of the cooler features of Suikoden's battles was the unite ability, which let two or more characters combine forces for a super attack. Suikoden II emphasizes these one-two attacks, giving players more of an incentive to experiment with new characters. Unlike those of some RPGs, Suikoden II's random encounters are quick and relatively painless - load time from the overworld or dungeon is almost nonexistent, and characters usually attack all at once, preventing the game's battles from being too big of an annoyance when one simply wants to advance the story. Magic, gained from rune crystals found throughout the world and in stores, earns experience similar to Final Fantasy VII's materia system, opening up more spells as you advance. Suikoden II doesn't use magic points; instead, it gives you a set number of uses for each spell per outing, making it one of the least magic-intensive RPGs on the market, another welcome break from the current trend."", ""As was the case with its predecessor, it feels as though an international conflict just can't be fully realized in Suikoden II without some large-scale battles. Instead of the strategy-free battle scenarios of the original, Suikoden II adds an actual strategic element to the game's battles. The end result can easily be likened to the TurboGrafx-16's classic, Military Madness - you position your units on a map and tell them to attack enemy units, defend, or use magic. These scenarios are far more interesting than the almost instantly winnable scenarios in Suikoden, but they still don't amount to much more than filler minigames, and many victories and defeats are determined by the game's story alone. While it's a minor point, some players will think they're winning and but then be forced to withdraw because of some random story event."", ""Aesthetically, Suikoden II is a few notches above its predecessor. The graphics are displayed in a noticeably crisper resolution than its predecessor. The game's town and overworld are entirely 2D and sprite-driven, while the battle engine combines polygonal terrain and spell effects with 2D characters. Brief CG cutscenes are sprinkled throughout the game, as well, bringing a little more life to scenes that just wouldn't have carried the same impact with simple 2D spritery. Nice hand-drawn portraits are shown for all the game's notable characters, as well. Even though the overworld graphics are beyond bland, the overall effect is an appealing one. The game, despite increased graphical detail, has little to no load time to speak of once you're in the game, an always welcome bonus. Suikoden II's sound is on par with the original's, sporting well-instrumented RPG fare, occasionally flaunting a vocal twist. The game's sound effects are nice and crisp, containing actual digital samples instead of the screechy synth noises of even Square's most expensive endeavors. The game's translation fares far better than the first title's did, overall. However, the competent text was obviously rushed through proofreading, marring what would otherwise have been a perfect translation. Fortunately, other than the text, nothing has been localized for the US version - characters actually drink alcohol, not soup or coffee, as many characters were forced to drink due to the heavy-handed censors of the Nintendo era."", 'Fans of the first Suikoden game will love the sequel - it improves on everything that had made the first game memorable. Suikoden II brings nothing new to the genre, but it executes well enough that no one will really care. --Peter Bartholow <br />--<i>Copyright 1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

But those looking for a ninja game of Tenchu\'s caliber will unfortunately have to keep on looking. <P>In fact, Soul of the Samurai has much more in common with Capcom\'s Resident Evil series than anything else. The premise sets you as one of two warriors (the masterless samurai Kotaro and female ninja Lin) who set out to stop an evil warlord from turning the local townsfolk into zombies for the undead army he plans to march against the shogun. The environments are made of static 3D backgrounds viewed from a preset, three-quarter overhead perspective. And instead of filing police reports RE-style - on a typewriter -to save your game, your character compiles a haiku. Seriously. The parallels are there, albeit, oddly through the looking glass. <P>The main problem with SOTS is the same one that Tenchu had: The combat is difficult because of the camera. While Tenchu makes up for the flaw by rewarding you for not getting into fights, SOTS requires you to battle. In fact, it demands so much hacking and slashing that it starts to feel like a mindless arcade-style beat \'em up like Eidos\' Fighting Force. The control commands include jump, slash, guard, draw/put away weapon, and you use items like throwing stars and bombs. Special moves can be pulled off by executing various combinations of slash and guard while maneuvering the directional pad, but mashing on the attack button appears to work best, and this actually lets you perform one of the specials on its own.  <P>The guard command also works to lock in on an enemy as in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time\'s Z-targeting function, only not nearly as elegantly. One reason for the shortcoming is that the environments are small and don\'t allow much room to move about and dodge attacks, but mainly it\'s because the camera angles make it hard to see which enemy you\'re lined up against. This is compounded by the fact that multiple enemies will attack at once - instead of the less realistic but more playable ""oh, my turn"" approach found in many similar games. You might be battling two enemies on a narrow path, and while you\'re blocking a blow by one of them, the other will likely rain an attack on you from behind. The game starts off extremely easy, but sections like this soon make it needlessly difficult.  <P>The positive side of SOTS is the story, which is told through the use of in-game engine sequences and subtitles. Instead of being broken up into different levels, the game is set in chapters. While the tale is fairly wooden and telegraphs its punches a mile away at times, the delivery is unique and often actually realizes the gaming clich&#xE9; of ""making you feel like part of the story."" If there were less filler battles and a better camera set-up, SOTS would be much more fun to play. In the end, the game is more of a curiosity rental than a title you\'d want to pick up for keeps. --Joe Fielder <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

You'll be called upon to exploit the New World's exotic resources and, in doing so, swing the balance of power to your advantage. An anchor in the New World means this: the riches and resources to dominate Europe once and for all. Strengthen your power base back in Europe. Deploy spies to help stay ahead of the technology curve. Build a formidable military, because you can get more with a kind word and a gun than with a kind word alone. And don't forget, the object is to unite Europe under one flag--yours!"", 'Imperialism was a bit of a surprise. A low-key, visually stylish economic and military conquest game, it didn\'t have much flash, but it had good gameplay in the Civilization/Railroad Tycoon mold. <P> Imperialism II sticks close to its roots. The maps and unit graphics are virtually identical to the first, and the fundamental gameplay is very similar. The main change is in the setting. Instead of playing as a robber baron in the age of industry, you play as a conqueror in the age of exploration. Those are two very different milieus for a strategy game, which helps make this feel like a true sequel rather than an expansion pack, but just by a whisker. <P> Developer Frog City has done some interesting things with the standard explore-and-conquer format, grounding it more firmly in history. It is still a turn-based strategy game with a tactical military element, but the particulars have changed a bit. When you start a new game, the known world is composed of the ""Old World."" This can be either a historical map of Europe or a random map. The Old World is made up of established neutral nations. To win, you must control one-half of this Old World. You can do that through military aggression or through economic and diplomatic means.  <P> The rest of the map is made up of the blacked-out, unknown ""New World,"" which you must explore and exploit. Forging alliances with native tribes and eventually taking over their land adds nothing to your total victory requirements, however. If you own the entire New World but still only have control over your original nation in the Old World, you won\'t win. The purpose of the New World is to add to your economic might: Exploitation of New World resources is essential to funding wars and expansion in the Old World. It\'s an interesting distinction grounded in historical reality. In the time period of the game (1500-1800), the New World\'s impact on the Old World was mostly one of supplying resources and influence. The true battleground was still Europe.  <P> Other changes to the system reflect the new strategies and economic realities of the period. Since this isn\'t an industrialized society, there\'s no need for mills and factories. Instead, goods are used for trade and sustaining your population. The population in turn is needed to process the goods. The most noticeable addition is the constant need to feed your population, which makes agriculture of central importance. Processing raw materials - the core of economic growth - takes a backseat to feeding the populace. This gets a bit tedious, even if it is historically accurate. <P> The most welcome addition is the ability to direct research. You can now choose which technology to develop next. Technologies improve the abilities of various units (ships move farther, military units are more powerful) or the yield of tile improvements, such as farms and mines. Internal development is still based on using special units to develop tiles to produce resources (food, minerals, etc), but these tiles must now be linked through a network of roads. Transportation allocation has been removed, so the goods now travel automatically. The military element has also undergone some subtle tweaking. Sieges are more common than skirmishes, and you can move units in any order now.. The latter remains an optional and not very interesting part of the game, but it\'s there for people who want more control over battles. <P> Imperialism was a good game with a cult following. You either liked it and stayed with it or found its low-key gameplay boring and quickly moved on. Its burnished bronze and sepia look wasn\'t necessarily what we expect from computer games, but the look was distinct and worked well in the context of the of the game. Imperialism II is a more refined and interesting use of the same system, with an excellent interplay of elements. Expansion is always checked by practical realities, and every alliance and war has a price. A well-balanced game with these elements is hard to create, and Frog City has done an excellent job of it with Imperialism II. <i>--Chet Thomas</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

889,Castlevania: Legacy of Darkness,"[""Dracula's a tough fellow to pin down, so to speak, so it's no surprise that the popular  Castlevania series has resurrected the nefarious guy nearly every year since the game's 1987 debut."", ""<i>Legacy of Darkness</i> is both a prequel and an update to the early 1999 release, <i>Castlevania</i>, for the  Nintendo 64.  Set eight years prior to its predecessor's narrative, the creepy story introduces a new main  character, Cornell, a young gent who moonlights as a werewolf. Dracula's posse has kidnapped Cornell's  younger sister, and the man-wolf must conquer a collection of enemies, including Dracula himself, to save  her. In addition to Cornell's quest, players can experience entirely unique adventures from the viewpoint of  three other characters, adding to the game's replayability."", 'With a slicker version of its precursor\'s game engine, <i>Legacy of Darkness</i> features improved graphics  (bumped up even a few more notches via an optional high-resolution <a href=""/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00001WRIU/${0}"">expansion pack</a>) and redesigned puzzles and levels.  Players navigate using a variety of gymnastic-style moves in the third person, with the camera following  them from an over-the-shoulder view.', 'This game is definitely best enjoyed after a garlic-heavy dinner with the lights off and doors locked.', '<i>--Eric Twelker</i>', ""Once titled - more accurately - Castlevania: Special Edition, Castlevania: Legacy of Darkness is what Konami's first Nintendo 64 Castlevania title was meant to be when it was released early this year. Everything from Castlevania 64 is present here in an enhanced director's cut version, which contains improved graphics, sound, and two extra scenarios featuring the new characters, Cornell the werewolf and the young warrior Henry. Like the original, Castlevania: Legacy of Darkness isn't very similar to Symphony of the Night on the PlayStation but is a hard-core version of the early titles in the series set in 3D. Taking place eight years before the first N64 game, C:LOD begins with Cornell journeying to Transylvania after his friend Ortega had betrayed him, allowing Cornell's sister Ada to be abducted by Count Dracula. Now it's up to you to rescue her, or die trying.  Instead of letting you play as any of the four characters from the start, C:LOD forces you to finish the game as Cornell before you can unlock the remaining three. As Cornell, you play through a mix of all-new levels and levels from the original that now carry different objectives. Cornell uses a sonic-boom-like punch as his primary weapon, and for close combat, he can use his claws to slash enemies. The weapons are pretty much the same as those found throughout the series: axes, daggers, crosses, holy water, and so on. Cornell himself is a little bit tougher to maneuver than Reinhardt or Carrie, because his lock-on is not as precise as theirs, and his attack is a bit slow. You'll end up facing in one direction for a few seconds while enemies attack you from behind and from the side. Cornell has the ability to morph into werewolf form, which makes his attacks and defenses stronger, but, disappointingly, there are no additional special moves. This new scenario is a lot of fun to explore, although, admittedly, it does seem to drag at points. Playing through Reinhardt's and Carrie's scenarios in the director's cut version isn't nearly as fresh an experience as playing as Cornell, but hard-core fans of the series will nevertheless enjoy playing through these now-more-difficult scenarios, with their new levels and bosses. Henry's mission is the shortest and least interesting of them all, requiring you to rescue seven children within six days.  The graphics found in Castlevania: Legacy of Darkness are a mixed bag. The game looks much more impressive with the use of the N64 Expansion Pak, but even with the Expansion Pak the frame rate is still very jittery, making it almost unplayable. Without the Expansion Pak, the game looks slightly better than the original. A few touchups have been made to the backgrounds, such as added textures to the walls and added details to the flowers in the gardens. Although it may downgrade the resolution, playing without the Expansion Pak makes the game run much smoother. It's a shame that Konami couldn't use the pak more effectively. Many complained about the lack of music in the original, but Legacy of Darkness contains a nice assortment of new tracks and remixes of classic Castlevania tunes. Other additions include the introduction of cinematics and the option to switch the camera into several different modes. Cornell's intro sequence isn't FMV but an in-game engine cinematic, the likes of which was missing in the original. It's not quite up to what Konami accomplished in Metal Gear Solid, of course, but it's entertaining, and it adds a little flavor to the character. You can now also change the game camera between three different perspectives. But there isn't one view that works well for every situation, and you have to keep switching between them to find the best view of the current action. For example, setting the camera to boss mode will place it so far back that your view is often blocked by a wall in areas inside the castle. Complaints aside, Castlevania: Legacy of Darkness is exactly what it sets out to be: a better version of the original. If you loved the first one, there's enough added value to justify picking this game up, even though it feels a little dated now, and its price is pretty steep. But if you're one of those people who felt that Castlevania should've never made the jump into 3D, Legacy of Darkness will do only a little more than the original in convincing you otherwise.<i>--Ike Sato</i>--<i>Copyright  1998 GameSpot Inc.

890,Konami Arcade Classics,"['Showcasing 10 Konami arcade games from the early to mid-1980s, this collection is a must-have for fans of the originals. Included here are arcade-perfect translations of <i>Pooyan</i>,  <i>Scramble</i>, <i>Yie Ar Kung Fu</i>, <i>Roc\'n\'Rope</i>, <i>Shao Lin\'s Road</i>, <i>Circus  Charlie</i>, <i>Super Cobra</i>, <i>Road Fighter</i>, <i>Time Pilot</i>, and <i>Gyrus</i>. While these  games aren\'t as well known as 1980s classics by Atari and Namco (think <i>Asteroids</i> and  <i>Pac-Man</i>), they are by no means second-rate. In fact, <i>Konami Arcade Classics</i> surpasses  similar collections by Atari and Namco in terms of bang for your buck, with only 2 of its 10 ""hits""  (<i>Shao Lin\'s Road</i> and <i>Road Fighter</i>) being duds.', ""While the games' graphics and sounds are obviously dated, the gameplay here is just as addictive as it was  in its day. In addition to standard retro video game package features such as a short animated movie intro  and brief background history, <i>Konami Arcade Classics</i> is vibration function-enhanced. Even  without this feature, a dual shock controller is recommended, as its analog stick is much truer to an arcade  joystick than using the standard directional buttons. <i>--Joe Hon</i>"", '<b>Pros:</b>', '', 'Konami has jumped on the classic-gaming bandwagon with a collection of its old arcade titles. The collection is a relatively low-frills compilation, but the quality of the games more than makes up for a deficiency in the history department. Most of the games in this collection are standouts. Who can forget great games like Yie Ar Kung Fu, Time Pilot, Scramble, Super Cobra, and Gyruss? The collection also includes some slightly lesser-known games, namely Pooyan, Circus Charlie, Shao-Lin\'s Road, Roc \'N Rope, and Road Fighter. All the games control very well, giving you the option of using the digital pad or the analog stick, though considering that all of these games used digital control in the arcade, there\'s no real advantage to using the analog control. The games make pretty good use of the vibration feature on the Dual Shock pad, which is a nice update that doesn\'t get in the way of the retro experience. The graphics are identical to those in the arcade games, though many of the scores and little things - like the fuel meter in Scramble and Super Cobra - have been moved to the right side of the screen to better preserve the original resolution. The sound is also identical to that of the original versions. A small history section that includes the games\' US release dates and a brief paragraph about each game rounds out the package. Also, the games load up with a coin already in each of them, so you never see any of the attract modes. Since this prevents you from seeing the message ""Invade the base and carry away booty"" in Super Cobra, it\'s a little disappointing. But if you hold any of these games (Yie Ar Kung Fu and Time Pilot are my personal faves) in high regard, you\'ll find that they still play well with a PlayStation controller, and this package is definitely worth picking up.<i>--Jeff Gerstmann</i>--<i>Copyright  1998 GameSpot Inc.

893,Vandal Hearts 2,"['PSX Role Playing series.  Hard to find sequel.', ""Although the RPG has gained popularity in the US, its tactical offshoot, the strategy-RPG, has had a harder time gaining similar popularity. However, among fans of the genre, no game has toppled Final Fantasy Tactics. As hard as Vandal Hearts II tries to emulate and even improve on FFT, VH2 falls short, but it still delivers an enjoyable strategy game. The first Vandal Hearts' story was digestible enough, but Vandal Hearts II unfortunately opts to fashion its story after Final Fantasy Tactics' incomprehensible saga. Joshua was but a poor peasant boy until he was manipulated into killing a revered political figure. Sure to be executed for this heinous act, Joshua fled his village and later founded a notorious band of mercenary thieves. These seemingly simple events set off a confusing political whirlwind of intrigue and betrayal that most people won't care to follow. For the most part, Vandal Hearts II's gameplay is standard strategy-RPG fare - you move your characters around a large world map and engage in turn-based battles on a variety of grid-based battlefields. However, unlike most games, this one doesn't follow a traditional turn-based model. As every game seems to feel the need to do these days, Vandal Hearts II employs an all-new system to differentiate itself from other games in the genre. The Dual Battle System lets the computer move characters and monsters during your turn, adding an interesting new strategic requirement. As interesting as the concept is, its execution is a little off - without any way of knowing in what order the enemy will attack, opponents will often move out of the way of your attacks. While you can work around this by wasting a move at the start of each turn to force the enemy to waste one of his turns, this really should be unnecessary. Vandal Hearts II's character-development system is limited when compared with that of the original, keeping things nicely framed and manageable. Unlike Final Fantasy Tactics' sprawling and unfocused job system, you can customize your characters with the game's wide assortment of weapons. Each weapon has one or more spells or abilities locked inside it. While initially inactive, a spell opens up after you've carried it in battle for several turns. Once a spell has been unlocked, it can be transferred to another weapon of the same type, making it beneficial to you to have characters that specialize in one type of weapon. While it is a little frustrating that you must stomp around the battlefield for a while to activate a weapon's abilities, you can enter any battlefield from the overworld map at any time to quickly enable whatever new spells your party may have before it fights any story-critical battles. Vandal Hearts II's visuals are just above average. The battlefield graphics are a few notches below Final Fantasy Tactics', but the battlefields themselves are much larger, making this an acceptable sacrifice. However, the squatty sprite-based characters that frolic on the maps are poorly animated and drawn. Worse still are the character portraits, all of which have awkward facial expressions and eight-bit-quality color depth. The orchestral soundtrack, however, is grandiose and epic, helping greatly to enhance the mood where the graphics don't. While Vandal Hearts II lacks the grand feel of Final Fantasy Tactics, it is a solid and rewarding strategy-RPG. It has flaws of its own, but it doesn't fall into the pitfalls that frustrated many of Final Fantasy Tactics' players, making it well suited for both veterans and newcomers to the genre.<i>--Peter Bartholow</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

895,Panzer General 3D Assault,"['<i>Panzer General 3D Assault</i> charts new territory for military strategy games by being the first of its kind to incorporate a three-dimensional environment without compromising the standards of depth and playability set by its predecessors. In this environment, forests burn during combat, cities and airfields can be destroyed, and units smoke and burn with damage. Additional features include a freely rotating camera and map, as well as a simplified and more intuitive interface. Besides making the leap into 3-D, <i>Panzer General 3D Assault</i> features a new combat system that truly puts the ""General"" in Panzer General. The system now emphasizes leader management instead of unit management. Players can promote, dismiss, or reassign their commanders in order to maximize their forces. As leaders gain experience and are promoted, they acquire more actions per turn and can perform more effectively. In addition to standard orders, leaders acquire and command up to 40 ""veteran"" orders, allowing them to launch all-out attacks, dive-bomb enemy positions, and attack with greater accuracy. Players can fight as the American, British, German, or French forces, choosing one of eight different campaigns on the Western Front during World War II, including North Africa. Ten areas of operation provide a variety of terrain and mission objectives. A new headquarters interface allows players to customize their armies to fit the upcoming battle. In addition to two-player combat via modem, <i>Panzer General 3D Assault</i> supports up to four players via LAN.', ""With its all-new 3D graphics engine and a handful of new features, Panzer General 3D Assault brings this popular turn-based tank-warfare series back for a third go-round. Though the 3D graphics can occasionally lead to command and control problems, the game is based on a good underlying system and offers the same brand of gameplay that made Panzer General such a huge hit. In short, it's more of the same, only better in most respects, which ought to be good news for fans of the series."", ""It won't take long to spot Panzer General 3D Assault's most prominent new feature: Instead of painted backgrounds and prerendered units, the game uses true 3D terrain maps and tiny little 3D-rendered unit graphics. As a result, this Panzer General looks very much like a tabletop miniatures game (but one played on a really cool tabletop that comes complete with rivers and little cities). The graphics are mostly good, and the rolling terrain is quite impressive. Unfortunately, the game suffers from the same problem as Panzer General II: Units in city hexes often get lost amidst the scenery. Also, aircraft float above their hexes but are often tough to pinpoint in areas cluttered with other units. Ordering aircraft to attack other aircraft can be confusing as well, as you must click on a destination hex square to move the planes, but then click on an airborne target that looks as if it's in a completely different spot."", ""However, once you get used to the 3D interface, most of these issues fade away. The only one that stays with you throughout is the lightning-fast combat resolution that occurs when units attack one another if you turn off the unit animation. As any Panzer General veteran knows, the combat animations are great for the first scenario or so, and then you shut them off to speed up gameplay. However, in Panzer General 3D Assault, it's difficult to tell what happened in a particular engagement unless you leave the animations on and watch the combat unfold. Otherwise, you pretty much have to go back and find the combatants on the map and highlight each to see who came out on top. Obviously, this is more of an issue when the AI takes its turn, since you can control the pace of your own attacks. You can click through moves to speed them up, but this can get repetitive. It's too bad there's no way to speed up the animations without actually skipping them."", ""Of course, there are some real benefits to the 3D engine. For starters, the maps and units are very well rendered, which gives the game an impressive and consistent look. Also, units that have sustained damage in combat will smoke and flame at varying levels to let you know their status. This is actually quite helpful when you're skimming the battlefield to see how things stand."", ""If you've played previous installments of this series, you probably won't have to change many habits in order to adapt to 3D Assault. Deep inside Panzer General 3D Assault's newfangled exterior lies a game very much like its predecessors, with the same basic wargaming system at play. Some of the extra features that had been added to Panzer General II are alive and well in this installment, including leaders with special abilities. Also, you can now make multiple moves and attacks with your units - the better a unit's leader is, the more actions it can take in a given turn. Some leaders let bombers operate even in bad weather, provide first-strike capabilities on every engagement, or let units avoid support fire from enemy artillery."", 'The game offers a new interface for managing all your leaders and the rest of your army between scenarios. Though the units look toy-like, and the process of assigning a leader to a unit could stand to gain a confirmation dialogue, this army-customization screen is fairly effective at simplifying the task of outfitting and upgrading your troops.', 'Panzer General 3D Assault includes eight campaigns that take place on the Western Front. Four of the campaigns are lengthy, full-fledged affairs, while the other four are much shorter minicampaigns. You can opt to command American, German, British, or French forces, and as in any Panzer General game, you can adjust all the various difficulty and game settings, such as the quality of reinforcements for both you and the AI.', 'The sound effects are pretty solid throughout, and each type of unit sounds appropriately different. Also, though they grow old in a hurry, some of the attack animations look pretty good. Dive-bombing attacks on ground units are particularly fun to watch. As with many SSI games, the musical score will probably strike a love-hate relationship with you; if you like the idea of stomping German forces to John Philip Sousa, then the music will suit you just fine.', 'Overall, Panzer General 3D Assault is a solid game built upon a proven game system. Despite its occasional problems, the 3D engine is a nice addition, and the gameplay is akin to Panzer General II with an even broader set of features, which should please most fans of the series. <i>--Michael E.

Still here? Then get ready for more ferocious virtual wrestling action, this time from WWF's corner of the ring. Brought to you by the brutes behind the highly-acclaimed <i>WCW/nWo Revenge</i> (considered by many to be the best wrestling game to date), <i>WWF: Wrestlemania 2000</i> throws into the ring over 50 World Wrestling Federation stars, each boasting his favorite moves and very distinct personality."", 'This one\'s got it all: awesome graphics, tons of characters and special moves, plenty of match varieties, and special touches like upgraded ring entrances. Pick a wrestler from the lineup or create a wrestler from scratch, choosing his appearance, taunts, and mannerisms. Then jump into the ring and show off your character\'s signature moves--from X-Pac\'s bronco buster to Chyna\'s ""ooh-that\'s-gotta-hurt"" low blow. With tag team, cage, and weapons matches, the action gets downright wicked. Players can even follow the Road to Wrestlemania, a story mode in which wrestlers grapple with the reality of competing week after week in special TV events in order to compete in the ultimate event, Wrestlemania 2000. No doubt that this game could likely be the champion of the ever-growing pack of wrestling titles. <i>--Eric Twelker</i>', 'THQ has been making WCW-licensed wrestling games for years. But a licensing shake-up has enabled the company to score the coveted WWF license that Acclaim held for years. THQ has a tremendous opportunity here to try something new with the license, and from the looks of the company\'s upcoming PlayStation title, WWF Smackdown, we may see something new yet. However, the company\'s first product, WWF Wrestlemania 2000 for the N64, is little more than a slightly upgraded version of WCW/NWO Revenge with a new set of wrestlers. So wrestling fans who are waiting for an all-new experience will have to keep on waiting. But WWF fans who skipped THQ\'s WCW games purely because of its license will be in for a game that plays well but captures only fleeting bits of the ""attitude"" that makes the WWF so popular. Additions to the engine include a sitting position for fallen enemies. You can pick wrestlers up off the mat and place them in a sitting position, or you can pick them up and put them on their feet. An in-depth create-a-wrestler mode has been added. But unlike WWF Attitude, the depth isn\'t found in how many different colors of pants you can put on your wrestler or how many different types of mullets you can slap onto your wrestler\'s head; rather, the draw here is that you can customize every single move. Want up and the A button from a weak grapple to be a backhand slap? Go for it. Want your wrestler to finish other wrestlers with the ""Insider\'s Edge,"" a rip-off of Scott Hall\'s Outsider\'s Edge? It\'s all you. A few other WCW finishers and taunts have made it into the game as well, so you can slap Scott Steiner\'s or DDP\'s taunt onto your wrestler if you so desire. Portions of the ring entrance walk are also customizable, as are things like ring entrance attire (hats, microphones, and water bottles are all available). You can set who your wrestler\'s rivals are, whom he walks to the ring with, how he reacts when and if he starts bleeding during a fight, and lots more. Digitized music and stills from the superstars\' video packages pepper the ring entrances, but both manage to detract from the experience rather than add to it. In theory, they make the introsmuch closer to reality than WCW/NWO Revenge\'s weak intros, but the quality of the entrance music is abysmal. Imagine a friend calling you up and playing entrance music over the phone - or perhaps a RealAudio file encoded at the lowest possible setting - and you\'ll be on the right track. The entrance ""video"" is similarly pathetic. It\'s a collage of still shots taken from the video intros, but the shots are taken at a very low resolution and blown up to fill the entire screen. It\'s a blocky, pixilated mess. You would think the developers would have splurged for a larger cart to make room for some higher-quality audio and video in the game. At least the wrestlers actually walking to the ring look better than those in Revenge did. Wrestlers come down the aisle with their managers, valets, or other companions. So, to answer the burning question, yes, Godfather comes to the ring with one of his hos. If you\'ve played Revenge, you already know exactly what to expect from Wrestlemania 2000. The game still uses the same grapple system, though it\'s a bit more reversal-friendly. The game is very easy to pick up and learn, but it takes a sense of timing to excel at the game. This makes it a wonderful multiplayer game. Playing alone, you\'ll be able to embark on the Road to Wrestlemania, the game\'s quest mode. Here, you\'ll pick a wrestler and his partner and fight your way through various WWF television shows, including Raw, Heat, and pay-per-views. You\'ll be booked into all sorts of different matches, and if you seem to excel in tag-team matches with your preselected partner, you\'ll be thrown into more of those. Other modes include king of the ring, three-way match, royal rumble, tag-team match, and cage match. Tossing the huge cage into the mix causes a bit of slowdown, and the cage looks a little strange up close, but it\'s still a welcome addition. You can also create your own pay-per-view shows and belts. Belt creation is a neat idea, but since the wrestlers never actually wear the created belts, you\'re limited to looking at a way-too-blurry picture of a belt before the match begins. Along with from the previously mentioned terrible digitized ring entrance music, the rest of the sound is really quite bad. The weak MIDI tracks that made up Revenge\'s entire soundtrack have returned, playing on menu screens and during matches. There\'s no speech or commentary in the game whatsoever. The sounds of people hitting each other and people bouncing off the mat sound pretty good, but this goodness is overshadowed by the rest of the game\'s weak sound. Graphically, the game improves upon Revenge, but the models are still blocky, and the textures used for faces, while more realistic than those in Revenge, just look weird. It\'s really strange to see The Rock\'s face frozen in the raised-eyebrow position while he wrestles. Also, most of the wrestlers\' heads are a little too square. The crowd is a collection of flat, sign-waving lunatics that get extremely tiresome after only a few minutes. WWF Wrestlemania 2000 does a lot of things right. It\'s got some good gameplay, though it may be a bit too simplistic for some. It improves on THQ\'s last N64 wrestling game by quite a lot, especially with the addition of a good create-a-wrestler mode. But the terrible sound, only passable graphics, and general lack of originality keep this title from reaching greatness. This engine has delivered some good games, but I think it\'s definitely time for an all-new engine.<i>--Jeff Gerstmann</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

900,Bass Master 2000 N64,"[""For those who enjoy the lure of fishing but can't stand the early hours, <I>Bassmasters 2000</I> offers the realism, detailed graphics, and inevitable fun one expects from a fishing simulation game endorsed by B.A.S.S. (Bass Anglers Sportsman Society)."", '<I>Bassmasters 2000</I> takes virtual anglers to highly detailed re-creations of the same lakes that are on the Bassmaster tournament circuit. Presented in a television-style format, the game features angling legends Shaw Grigsby and Roland Martin providing up-to-the-moment commentary and expert advice. Off the lake, players can visit a virtual tackle shop to upgrade bait and equipment, and the create-an-angler mode lets players choose a distinct personality. A split-screen, two-player mode offers a witness to confirm or deny that inevitable tale about the big one that got away. <i>--Eric Twelker</i>', 'Feel the need to get out on the lake and do some fishing, but you just can\'t break away from the daily grind long enough to make the trip? Perhaps you need to reorganize your priorities, my friend. But until that day, you can always use THQ\'s latest fishing game, Bassmasters 2000, to tide you over. The game has a lot of impressive features, such as real lakes, color commentary, and even a create-an-angler mode. You can choose from several different modes of play including a speed-fishing mode that lets you jump right into the action, a casting game that helps improve your casting accuracy, a two-player split-screen mode, and a tournament mode. One of the best things about Bassmasters 2000 is its wonderfully designed control scheme, which really makes you feel as though you have a fishing rod in your hands. The analog stick controls your rod very precisely. In addition, the game has reel speeds, and it also lets you change the amount of drag you have set. All of these things are taken into account when you hook a fish, so knowing the basics of fishing is essential. If you\'ve got your drag set too high, or you try to reel the fish in too fast when it\'s fighting, or you\'re not fast enough when it\'s not fighting, the line could break, or the fish could simply slip off the hook. Whatever the outcome, playing the game is a whole lot of fun thanks to the responsive controls and true-to-life setup, which makes playing more about what you do and how you do it than about sheer luck. As in any business, catching big bass is all about location. Bassmasters 2000 does a wonderful job of representing this fact by putting the fish right where they\'d be in real life, based on the weather conditions and time of day. Your cherry bass boat, outfitted with a depth finder, makes finding good fishing spots a fun little activity. Visually, all of the different types of fish and lakes look accurate, as do your angler, boat, and gear. The camera angle that shows the underwater action, letting you scan for nearby bass, is pretty good. Being able to see a fish as it\'s about to strike your lure is actually pretty exciting - you\'ll wish you could have such a view in real life. The game features several sizes of fish, so you know which ones are worth your time. Even the sound and music in Bassmasters 2000 are rather good, although the color commentary provided by Shaw Grisby becomes a little unnerving after awhile. He mostly just belts out stupid one liners that are either insulting or overly happy, like ""You can\'t catch any fish without getting your bait wet,"" or the constant ""Nice cast!"" In any case, the game\'s audio does get the job done, with lots of decent sound effects and a couple of backwoods-style music tracks. In the end, Bassmasters 2000 is a great game with wonderful controls, true-to-life fish behavior, and great graphics and sound. This game will definitely please any angler, whether a real-life bass-fishing expert or a beginner looking for some practice.<i>--Ryan Mac Donald</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

901,Ultimate 8 Ball - Playstation,"[""<I>Ultimate 8 Ball</I> offers 14 different games, including classic 8 ball (playable with both U.S. and U.K. rules), 10 pin, and killer pool. For those novice pool players who don't know their speed pool from straight pool, there is a helpful manual that explains the specific rules for each game variation."", 'Multiplayer functions include head-to-head and round-robin (for up to 15 players) competition. Solo players compete against an array of characters like the Sayonara Kid and Slim Chance, who dress the part of wacky pool sharks. You can choose from pool tables in a variety of shapes, including diamond and L-shaped tables, as well as the standard rectangular table. Strangely, you can also select different textures and patterns, such as stripes, checks, and argyle.', 'This game does an adequate job of capturing an accurate ball trajectory for both simple and complex shots, which is evident through the resulting spins, speed, and rebounding. However, where this title really excels is in the training mode. For each shot there is a text description and video of a player making the shot, followed by unlimited opportunities to practice the shot. Players of all skill levels can not only practice, but master basic positional plotting and advanced shots that can be used in this game as well as on a real table.', ""While the graphics are a bit dark and the music uninspiring, this is a fun game for players of all skills who don't want to leave the house to rack up a few balls. <I>--Kasty Thomas</I>"", '<b>Pros:</b> <ul> <li>Superior training mode</li> <li>Variety of playing surfaces</li> <li>Good ball physics</li> </ul> <b>Cons:</b> <ul> <li>Loose control makes aiming less precise</li> </ul>', ""As much as I wish differently, Ultimate 8 Ball isn't a game about the best bottle of Olde English 800 malt liquor ever bottled. Instead, it's one of the many pool simulations available for the PlayStation. <P>While Ultimate 8 Ball has most of the options and modes that previous games like Pool Hustler and Backstreet Billiards had, it doesn't put on a good show in the form of a plot-driven mode. The game's closest thing to this is the hustle mode, which lets you play any of the game's various versions of pool against opponents who vary in skill and appearance. Ever wanted to play pool against Satan? Hey, who hasn't? With Ultimate 8 Ball, you can rack 'em up with the devil himself and go at it. <P>There are 14 different pool variants on the disc, ranging from common games like eight ball and nine ball to more obscure games, such as speed pool, killer, and one pocket. These games can be played against the CPU opponents in single games or in the hustle mode. You can also set up tournaments with up to 16 players. The school-of-pool mode teaches you the basics of the game, but it also has an advanced section complete with trick shots. While it would have been nice to have a brief controller tutorial in there, a quick read of the manual and an hour or so in the practice mode will have you sinking balls like Bobby Brady himself. <P>The game's graphics are good enough, though the overall frame rate just doesn't seem to be smooth enough, occasionally resulting in balls that look as if they're skipping across the table. Also, the pulled-back camera angles used when the computer players shoot is nice in theory, but the table becomes a little too muddy to make out what's going on. Thankfully, you can switch to an overhead view after the shot takes place and watch the action from there, but unfortunately, you can't ditch all the environmental graphics and lock the game into this overhead mode. The sound effects are nice and realistic, but the music is catchy in that annoying sort of way. You'll find yourself tapping your toe to the upbeat tracks, only to realize that you utterly despise the music that is now trapped in your head. <P>Overall, Ultimate 8 Ball is a nice, solid pool simulation. It does have a few extras, though it would have been nice to see the hustle mode extended into a full-on plot-driven story like Backstreet Billiards. If you've already purchased a pool simulation within the last year, you'll probably only need to rent this one and give it a whirl for a day or two. But if you're looking to make a purchase, Ultimate 8 Ball is definitely in the running with those other pool sims. --Jeff Gerstmann <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

902,Sanitarium - PC,"['Divided into a set of chapters, Sanitarium is an adult game of psychological complexity. You play the role of an amnesia patent, a girl named Sarah, a comic book hero, and an Aztec warrior. The plot is not obvious, and the game provides scattered hints that reveal their importance later. Sanitarium is best described as a horror story, not suitable for young children, with adult graphics and puzzles.', 'Spiraling upward out of the void, you open your eyes and struggle to comprehend your environment. Underneath you, the springs of an institutional cot sink almost to the floor. The mattress is roughly the thickness of a paper towel and reeks of affliction. Vague memories assault you: a hurried phone call, a message of utmost importance, a car losing control. Your head throbs. In the background, you hear people screaming, sobbing, and laughing maniacally. Is it a nightmare? Are you insane? Is it reality? Maybe this is death.']"
903,MTV Sports Snowboarding,"['To create MTV Sports: Snowboarding, Radical Entertainment used an improved version of its X Games Pro Boarder engine, which, in case you missed it, was a great snowboarding game published by Electronic Arts last year. If you were a fan of X Games Pro Boarder, then you\'ll definitely like MTV Sports: Snowboarding since it\'s really the ""unofficial"" sequel.', ""What made X Games Pro Boarder such a great game is also what makes this game great - the easy and intuitive control, along with incredibly spacious courses that really let you explore the mountain. The typical boundaries that restrict you to a narrow run, found in other snowboarding games, are all but absent on most courses. And even when you do come across them you can usually simply jump over them. The game has six boarders to choose from, each with his own style, strengths, and weaknesses. The boarders aren't terribly different from one another, but if you have one area that you prefer (speed, maneuverability, and so on), the differences do help. You can also choose from a variety of boards from real manufactures like K2, Libtech, and Forum."", ""The game features five game modes - qualifying, challenge, create-a-park, head-to-head, and training - to get you used to the controls. The qualifying mode is where you start out and where you must rack up enough points on three levels to enter the challenge mode. Once you have enough points, you can compete against other boarders and enter the challenge mode, where you race for time against other boarders, as well as perform for points in trick events. Whoever has the best combined times and/or higher trick points moves on. The create-a-park feature lets you create your own course. This feature offers limited options, but it's still kind of cool to set up a monster-jump course to try out. The head-to-head mode pits you against a human opponent in a point contest or a timed race."", ""At the game's outset, there are four regions to choose from: the US, Japan, Norway, and New Zealand. Each region is broken up into various events: mountain X, big air contest, half-pipe, and slopestyle. Completing the challenge mode will open up more hidden levels and events."", ""The responsiveness and overall control setup of the game are elegantly simple and easy for beginners to get used to. Once you get used to the basic controls, you can attempt more-advanced trick combinations and maneuvers just as you would in real-life snowboarding. There are tons of different combinations of tricks, grabs, and aerial maneuvers that you'll learn to perform with time and practice."", 'Visually, MTV Sports: Snowboarding is pretty good. Each boarder has a distinct look. The boarders move and sway as they cut down the mountain and perform all their tricks realistically. Ad banners, camera towers, trees, advisory signs, patches of earth, as well as jumps, half-pipe areas, and rails can be seen and used on the courses. The backgrounds and mountains far off in the distance look extremely good as well.', 'The soundtrack for MTV Sports: Snowboarding features real music like Blink 182\'s ""Don\'t Leave Me Alone"" and ""Wendy Clear,"" Face to Face\'s ""Disconnected,"" Fear Factory\'s remake of ""Cars,"" and Ministry\'s ""Jesus Built My Hotrod,"" to name a few. Needless to say, this collection of music makes for one of the best soundtracks for a PlayStation game ever. The sound effects for falling, riding over rocks, and cutting hard on the snow are also pretty good.', ""In the end, the free-roaming unrestricted feeling you get when you play MTV Sports: Snowboarding, combined with the great control setup, make it so much fun - and, ultimately, more of a snowboarding game than any other title out there. If you're a fan of snowboarding games and love to catch big air and see just how many times you can spin and flip while executing a bunch of different grabs before the ground comes rushing up, this is the game for you. --Ryan Mac Donald <br />--<i>Copyright 1999 GameSpot Inc.

You get points for completing laps, yes, but the real high scores--and the real fun--come from making high-speed impacts.', ""This is a decent racing game, fun and fast-paced. But where 3DO has really raised the bar is with the crash effects. Cars collide with a satisfying crunching sound. Smoke belches from under what's left of your hood. Car parts go flying. Huge dents appear right at the point of impact--even the taillights go out, one by one. After a few minutes your car looks like something out of a junkyard."", 'All this carnage makes <i>Destruction Derby 64</i> one of the most fun car racing games to appear in quite a while. Aside from the pure and simple smash-\'em-up derbies, you can choose a traditional looped racetrack race. Well, not exactly traditional: half of the cars race in one direction, the other cars go in the opposite direction. What happens when the two racing groups meet isn\'t pretty, but it is fun. Bonus: one track is laid out in a crash-inducing figure eight, just like your favorite <a href=""/exec/obidos/B00000ITHG/${0}"">Hot Wheels</a> sets.', 'The game\'s only weakness is the save functionality: you need a <a href=""/exec/obidos/ B00000K4TW/${0}"">memory card</a> to save, and even then you need to complete an entire series to save and move to the next level. Too bad you can\'t save after every race: it would have reduced the annoyance factor considerably. But, nitpicking aside, the combination of high-speed racing and good old-fashioned smash-\'em-up thrills makes <i>Destruction Derby 64</i> a first-place winner. <i>--Jeanne Uy</i>', ""<b>Pros:</b> <ul> <li>Car-smash effects are realistic</li> <li>Contains both circuit track racing and dirt-field demolition derby events</li> <li>Rear-view, drive-backwards mode is a nice improvement over other games</li> <li>Great multiplayer game for up to 4 players</li> </ul> <b>Cons:</b> <ul> <li>Can't save after every race</li> <li>Not enough variety in standard cars</li> </ul>""]"

Assuming the role of one of seven pro bowlers, each with unique playing characteristics, players compete using Brunswick Circuit Pro Bowler rules, equipment, and lanes (14 in all).

Jeremy McGrath was OK, but it failed to capture the feel of the sport. Moto Racer's dirt bike tracks were good but too limited. And of course there was VMX Racing, which was a complete joke. Out of the lot, Championship Motocross Featuring Ricky Carmichael is a step a above the competition in just about every category."", 'Championship Motocross Featuring Ricky Carmichael is a 3D motocross game that gives you a realistic interpretation of the sport. Championship Motocross features five different modes of play: championship, quick race, two player, time attack, and practice. Championship mode lets you progress through each race in the hopes of being crowned the dirt-bike-racing champion of the world.', 'The game features three teams for you to select from. Each team can choose from a 125cc, 250cc, or a 500cc bike. Each bike is rated in engine power, power band, top speed, weight, jumping, cornering, rough terrain, and suspension. Picking the right bike for each track is essential. In each race, you are up against seven other riders who, of course, all want to be in first place as well.', 'You compete on a total of 12 different tracks. Five of them are motocross tracks, four are supercross, and three are enduro-based courses. To vary the racing experience on the tracks, you can select three different weather settings: overcast, rain, and normal. You can also race the courses mirrored.', ""The control is fairly responsive and intuitive, although the designers left a little play in the control so that you get the feeling that the bike's going to pop out from underneath you at any moment. The only real trick when playing is not to go too fast into a turn. Using the power-turn button when coming around a tight corner really helps, although if you power-turn too much you'll end up going the wrong way. There's really no secret to winning any of the races in the game - all you have to do is pick your line and try to get around the corners as tightly as possible. When coming off any of the big jumps in the game, it's actually quite fun to pull off tricks in the air, although if you're like me you'll have to keep in mind that races aren't won on style. After you catch some air, a little distance indicator will come up and discretely let you know just how far and high the jump was. Each course has its own records in four different categories: fastest course time, fastest lap, longest jump, and highest jump. These course records can be saved to a memory card so that you can continually try to improve on them."", ""Visually, Championship Motocross looks decent. It doesn't suffer from too much pop-up, and the 3D models of the riders and bikes look good, as do the spectators, tents, cars, hay bales, and other ambient objects on the sides of the tracks. The animations of the rider performing tricks, leaning, sticking his leg out in a turn, and other various movements look fairly realistic. The game has a good frame rate and moves at a brisk pace - it really gives you a good false sense of speed. All this, along with the occasional rooster tail of mudflying off the tires, gives the game a good look that matches the controls well."", ""The sound effects for the bikes and the announcer are fairly good and add to the game's feel. In addition, the game features a loud rock soundtrack that can be almost overwhelming at times."", ""Championship Motocross Featuring Ricky Carmichael, with its control, visuals, and overall feel is the best motocross game for the PlayStation.

In <i>Nuclear  Strike</i>, players take command of more than 10 military vehicles--from Apache helicopters and Harrier  jets to ground-based hovercraft and tanks--on a daring set of missions to annihilate the bad old terrorists."", ""Players venture through 15 explosive missions in such exotic locales as Southeast Asia and the South  Pacific. Each mission is unique, requiring pilots to offer air support for ground troops, drop off supplies  within a heavily defended area, or carry out search-and-destroy operations, among other tasks. The arcade- style action is enhanced with smart enemy artificial intelligence, detailed graphics with brilliant special  effects, and intuitive controls that keep players' trigger fingers happy. <i>--Eric Twelker</i>"", ""EA's long-running Strike series has its share of both fans and detractors. Given the mediocre performances of the last two games in the series, Soviet Strike and Nuclear Strike, the detractors seem to be winning. Nuclear Strike for the N64 is, thankfully, a much better game than it was when it was released on the PlayStation back in 1997. As such, this mission-based shooter is a reasonably fun and cohesive adventure. The game takes you through various missions in each level. While you may start out simply clearing a battlefield of radar towers in your helicopter, before too long you might end up playing escort to some rebels or destroying large fortresses. Thankfully, there's a helpful map that lets you keep track of where all the mission objectives, enemies, and items are. This map is enhanced further by an onscreen compass that points you to items on the map, from armor pickups to enemy jeeps. Your chopper controls well with both the analog and digital controls, but the game doesn't actually feature any analog support. It would have been nice to execute slight turns and move ahead at half speed, but the game simply doesn't allow it. Jinking controls on the shoulder buttons and Z-trigger make it very easy to circle-strafe around any enemy. One of the many complaints with the PlayStation version was that it was nearly impossible to line up with any hostages or items close enough to winch them up. The N64 version has a helpful shadow that makes lining up the winch extremely easy. This alone makes the N64 version infinitely better than the PlayStation version. Nuclear Strike features pretty good sound, though most of it consists of simple weapons fire and explosions. There is, however, some speech in the game, which is usually played after you've completed an objective. This speech is well done. The game takes advantage of the expansion pak, letting you run in a higher resolution. The game only looks slightly more pixelated without the expansion, and it runs at a playable frame rate regardless. The varied mission design and fast action of Nuclear Strike make it a worthwhile shooter, even if the game it was based on is more than two years old. Some players may find that the enemies don't aim well enough, making the game a little too easy, but it's a fun experience regardless. Just start out playing it on the hard difficulty to ensure you get your money's worth.<i>--Jeff Gerstmann</i>--<i>Copyright  1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

First was Zombie Interactive's Spec Ops, released earlier this year. Both Novalogic and Interactive Magic have their own games coming out later this year. Now, Red Storm Entertainment weighs in with its own game, buoyed by the marketable name of Tom Clancy and his story-telling capability. Players take control of the international Rainbow team of super-secret operatives, doing the dirty work other modern nations wouldn't publicly touch. While generally better than Spec Ops, Rainbow Six carries its own baggage, especially where the conflict of realism versus gameplay rears its ugly head."", 'Rainbow Six offers several modes of play, including a large variety of training missions (different shooting ranges, obstacle courses, single-team hostage rescue, multiteam hostage rescue, and so on), the main campaign, and various multiplayer scenarios (like cooperative mission, deathmatch, and team deathmatch). The campaign can be played in one of three difficulty levels, with more objectives and less team casualty tolerance as the difficulty level increases. The campaigns resemble a tree trunk rather than a branching tree, so to get to the next mission, you must successfully complete the previous one.', 'Rainbow Six contains two main parts: mission planning and mission execution. For the first four missions in the campaign, Red Storm has provided a prescripted mission plan, but the next 12, you must do all the work. First comes the mission storyline and notes from various characters, of which most is not required reading to finish the mission. After picking which agents to use on the mission, what team they\'ll be on, and what equipment they\'ll use, it\'s time to hit the mission planning interface. The player is supplied with a complete floor plan of the area in question, possible and known locations of terrorists, where the mission objectives are, and so on. The player lays out where the teams will go, which ""go"" codes to use, the rules of engagement, and speed options. While a 3D rendering of the map is available, the only downside is that you can no longer see the movement paths of your teams; they\'re covered up.', ""After making sure you've got the mission planned (and make sure it's been saved), it's time to play out the mission. The interface is fairly similar to any number of modern first-person games like Quake II and Unreal, and graphically, the game is on par or slightly better than Spec Ops. The game models human motions and movement extremely well, including many different unique actions. Rainbow Six's audio cues, background sounds, and other various noises are also represented very well; the immersive feeling of Rainbow Six is perhaps one of the best seen in a game. The only downside is that, for some, the mouse interface can be a bit sensitive for those that are not used to it and can only be tuned from Windows."", ""A mission plays out as you take control of one of the teams, the others follow scripted layouts already devised in the mission planner. You can switch between the teams easily, but not team members. Teams follow waypoints, engaging enemies that come within range with ruthless efficiency (or mindless stupidity, as you'll learn) or waiting for a go code to move on to the next waypoint. With some decent planning and a bit (or lots) of human guidance, you can complete the missions and the game."", ""Well, it seems a bit simple, but in reality, Rainbow Six is pretty hard. The game skirts the magical barrier between realism and gameplay, hedging a bit on realism on some features and going straight overboard on the gameplay front. While combat is fast and furious, with one or two bullets almost guaranteeing a kill, the AI is schizophrenic at best and can kill your members at a moment's notice without them having the slightest clue as to how they can react to an adverse situation."", ""For example, suppose you had a team of four members moving down a corridor with rooms on either side. Let's say the team is moving to the other end of the corridor, and a terrorist is in one of the side rooms. As each member goes by the room, the terrorist guns him down. He doesn't react to the fire except by rushing toward the next waypoint like an eager lemming. Terrorists seem to react the same way; one particular encounter saw a terrorist calmly smoking a cigarette standing around the bodies of two dead buddies. Grenades seem to have an explosion range of about two feet."", ""Obviously, lots can go wrong in a mission. You will spend lots of time refining your mission layout, which really gives the impression that the missions are puzzle-oriented, which, in a way, they are. Typically, you'll be doing lots of the work (killing) personally, since the AI handles tight room environments very badly. Expect to replay missions 20, 30, or 40 times to complete them without high casualty counts. At times, it can get very annoying and frustrating. Then again, if you treat the entire game as things would happen in real life, Rainbow Six would be insanely difficult - with all its faults, it's fairly hard enough already."", 'Multiplayer saves the game though and allows basically unlimited replay of the missions with multiple teams (making coordination and reaction times much better, despite the typical lag), and deathmatches are sweaty do-or-die affairs where one good bullet to the head puts you out for the rest of the game. Replayability is also helped by the fact that there are a lot of different ways to complete a mission, and they get much harder as the difficulty level goes up.', ""So, just what is Rainbow Six? It's actually a pretty good game, albeit very hard and extremely frustrating. Some of the gameplay mechanics simply go straight against common sense, but some concessions had to be made to accommodate computer gameplay. Other elements are very realistic, and some of the gameplay elements are right on the money. Players who thought Spec Ops had lots of potential but didn't execute well should check out Rainbow Six because, despite the faults, the game does work better and does have that immersive, realistic feel. Players can even experiment with the game mechanics by looking at some of the definition files in the Rainbow Six directory. Rainbow Six is a pretty good game that over time - and perhaps with official and unofficial support - may become a great game. -- <i> Alan Dunkin</i> <br />--<i>Copyright 1999 GameSpot Inc.

918,Age of Empires,"['<i>Age of Empires</i> is an epic, real-time strategy game spanning 10,000 years. Starting with minimal resources, players guide the evolution of small Stone Age tribes into great civilizations. Gamers can choose one of several ways to win the game, including world domination by conquering enemy civilizations, exploration of the known world, and economic victory through the accumulation of wealth.', 'Age of Empires was a highly anticipated game for the Mac because when it was released for the PC, it was widely viewed as a milestone in real-time strategy. Age of Empires is a unique hybrid of empire-building strategy games like Civilization II and real-time action strategy games like WarCraft, and it delivers a unique gaming experience.', ""On the surface, Age of Empires delivers the empire-building goods, encouraging you to advance your civilization from the Stone Age through to the Iron Age. However, this is about the only likeness to Civ II-style empire-building in the game. Unlike Civilization, in which your empire advances thanks to research and improvements, in Age of Empires your nation advances because you hoard resources and pay your way into first the Tool Age, then the Bronze Age, and finally the Iron Age. The result is that the notion of empire building is mainly a formality. With each advancement you can obtain improved buildings, naval ships, and units, but that doesn't necessarily change your strategy."", ""Strategy is, in fact, reduced to naval supremacy. Whichever player gets the most powerful navy first will generally win the game. Naval units are able to bombard buildings and land units and have a tremendously unfair advantage. Poor unit AI also has a big impact on Age of Empires's playability. Computer-controlled units are smart, very smart - even SkyNet and Terminator smart - while your units are dumb as bricks, unable to get from point A to point B without help."", ""All things considered, there is still a lot to like in Age of Empires. Despite the flaws in the empire-building aspects, the game adds a new twist to real-time strategy gaming, and that is enough to outweigh, or at least compensate for, many of the game's problems. If you're tired of the Command &amp; Conquer clone, this game definitely offers something different. Age of Empires still uses the tried-and-true resource-gathering model of C&amp;C and WarCraft, but instead of one or two resources, you now have four to contend with, which adds more complexity to the game."", 'There is also a huge variety of units to play with. Military units come in Infantry, Archer, Cavalry, and Siege varieties, each one possessing characteristics that advance as you advance from the Stone Age. The Infantry is the workhorse of the military, starting out as a simple man with a club and evolving to a heavily armored, tough Centurion. One of the most enjoyable parts of Age of Empires is advancing the military units.', 'Overall, the single-player game has quite a bit of depth to it. There are easily 40 to 50 hours worth of missions to complete. The missions can get a bit redundant, and some of the mission objectives are very difficult, but a mission editor greatly enhances long-term playability. Multiplayer games are limited to playing against other Mac users only.', ""Age of Empires is a compelling game, largely because it diverges in so many ways from traditional real-time strategy titles. But because Age of Empires treads new paths, it makes a few mistakes along the way, some of which can be forgiven and some of which are frustrating. Flaws aside, you'll have a good time playing. - Rick Sanchez"", '<b>Good News:</b> Unique, deep gameplay. Large variety of units. Lots of missions for long playability. Mission editor.', '<b>Bad News:</b> Poor unit AI. Naval units are too strong and unbalance gameplay.', '1999 MacAddict -- <i><a href=""https://secure.imaginemedia.com/group/maca/8VPX.html"">From MacAddict -- Subscribe now!</a></i><br /><br />When you first play Age of Empires, a warm feeling develops in your gut. Warcraft meets Civilization! Real-time empire-building! And does it ever look sharp and feel right.', ""But an uneasy feeling builds as you get deeper into it, a sense that all is not quite right. This is not quite the game you hoped for. Even worse, it has some definite problems. The pitfall when you review a game as anticipated and debated as this one is to make sure you criticize it for what it is, not for what you wish it was. I wish that Age of Empires was what it claimed to be - Civilization with a Warcraft twist. Instead, it is Warcraft with a hint of Civilization. That's all well and good, but it places it firmly in the action-oriented real-time combat camp, rather than in the high-minded empire-building of Civilization. The result is Warcraft in togas, with slightly more depth but a familiar feel."", 'Age of Empires places you on a map in an unexplored world, provides a few starting units, and lets you begin building an empire. Each game unfolds the same way. You begin with a town center and some villagers. The villagers are the basic laborers, and the town center enables you to build more of them and expand your settlement. The villagers are central to AOE: they gather resources, build structures, and repair units and buildings. Resources come in four forms: wood, food, stone, and gold. A certain amount of each is consumed to build various units and buildings, research new technology, and advance a civ to the next age.', 'There is no complex resource management or intricate economic model at work here. What you have is the same old real-time resource-gathering in period garb, with four resources instead of one or two. As your civ advances, you develop greater needs for these resources, but the way in which they are gathered and used becomes only marginally more complex (certain research can cause faster harvesting or more production). It appears on the surface to be a complex evocation of the way early civs gathered and used materials, but beneath the hood is the same old ""mine tiberium, buy more stuff than the other guys"" model. It is the first hint that AOE is a simple combat game rather than a glorious empire-builder.', ""There's no denying the thrill the first time a villager chucks a spear at an antelope and spends several minutes hacking meat from its flank with a stone tool. This is the level of detail that brings an empire-building game to life. If only those villagers would grow and develop over the course of the game, it would make it so much more interesting. If only they would trade in their loincloths for some britches and maybe some orange camouflage, and switch from spears to arrows and rifles. Yes, that's another game, but it could easily have been done in AOE, and why it wasn't is a mystery."", ""The problem is that while enemy AI is savvy and aggressive (it can afford to be since it appears to cheat with resources), your units are bone-stupid. Path-finding is appallingly botched, with units easily getting lost or stuck. There is a waypoint system, but that hardly makes up for the fact that your units have trouble moving from point A to point B if you don't utilize it. Military units will stand idly by while someone a millimeter away is hacked to pieces. They respond not at all to enemy incursion in a village and wander aimlessly in the midst of battle. Was this deliberate so that the gamer needed to spend more time in unit management? If so, it was a poor idea, since there is simply too much going on midgame to worry about whether your military is allowing itself to be butchered in one corner of the map while you are aggressively tending to a battle in another portion."", ""AOE obviously is sticking close to an early-empire motif, and there's nothing at all wrong with that. Stone, Tool, Bronze, and Iron are the four ages, and with each come new structures and military units. You don't earn these advanced ages - you buy them with resources. Advancement is a simple matter of hoarding and spending food and gold. The overall welfare of your state is irrelevant as long as it survives: happiness is not measured, trade is barely modeled, and the state exists merely to produce a military machine to crush everyone else on the map. Naval power has a woefully unbalancing effect upon gameplay, with a strong navy able to shred the competition at the expense of reality."", 'Micromanagement is the name of the game in AOE. There is no unit queue, and to build five villagers, you need to build one, wait, build another, and so on. With units acting so stupidly, you should be able to set their level of aggression and the manner in which they attack (a la Dark Reign), but that is also not an option. Diplomacy is relegated to tribute and nothing more, and alliances are hard to form. You can be allied, neutral, or at war with other civs, but if the radio button is still set to ""allied"" when an opponent starts firing on your units, your units will not fire back, defend themselves, or even flee. They will just be destroyed. Cues as to exactly what\'s happening on the map are obscure; the duty has been relegated to unrelated sound effects. Does that bugle call mean my building is finished being built, or my units are under attack? How about some help, people? Victory conditions can also be irritating. There are several campaigns that require that specific goals be met, and these quickly grow tiresome. Thankfully, there is an excellent custom generator that lets you set map size, starting tech, resources, and other features. This is the saving grace of AOE, and what kept me coming back again and again. The main reason is that it let me change some of the insane default victory requirements, such as when the victor is the first to build a ""wonder"" (through another massive consumption of resources) that stands for 2000 years. These 2000 years can pass in about twenty minutes of game time. That means that as soon as an opponent builds a wonder, you create a whacking huge navy to go over and blow it up. Not a very subtle way to maintain an empire. In fact, there is no strategic nuance: It is merely a brawny muscle contest.', ""If all these judgments seem harsh, it is only because Age of Empires looked, and pretends, to be so very much more. It still has tons of potential and a fundamental gameplay that remains entertaining enough to overcome the flaws and merit a fair rating. The system can go very far with some fine-tuning, but as it stands it seems downright schizo. Is it a simplified Civilization or a modestly beefed up Warcraft? It's almost as if the designers started out to create one game and ended up with another. With such beautiful production and the fundamentals of a vastly entertaining game, it's sad that it fell short of the mark. The disappointment is not merely with what AOE is, but with what it failed to be. <i>--T. Liam McDonald</i> <br /><i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

919,Unreal Mission Pack - PC,"['This software is BRAND NEW. Packaging may differ slightly from the stock photo above. Please click on our logo above to see over 15,000 titles in stock.', ""The difficulty in reviewing a game like Unreal is keeping in mind what has come before it while at the same time allowing the game to flesh out its own sense of style and gameplay. Unreal is not Quake. The look is different. The feel is different. And what gives Unreal an edge is how these differences, while not always positive, distinguish it from the legions of other 3D shooters. <P> In Unreal, you are a prisoner aboard a ship en route to a penal colony. The ship crashes on a mysterious planet where the mystical Nali race is being subjugated by the cruel and technologically advanced Skaarj. As you journey through the many environments on the planet, you must find a means of escape from the planet and help the Nali defeat their oppressors. Unreal intertwines the feel of the medieval Nali architecture and culture with the sci-fi design of the weapons and the Skaarj warriors to create an environment that's a step above other games of its ilk. <P> As far as the game itself, the graphics are incredible. Unreal has the best graphics of any first-person shooter - and possibly of any game - to date. The palette is bright and varied, while the textures are intricate and well defined. The quality of textures deserves high praise - they help create environments that really take hold of you. The levels are so detailed and distinct that it's easy to distinguish one level from all the others, and you won't confuse the prison spacecraft for the Nali village. In conjunction with the graphics, the level design is advanced and complex. The mix of wide-open spaces and cramped hallways is refreshing. As far as graphics go, you just can't beat Unreal's immersion factor. <P> Combining an alien world with weapons that seem alien themselves has produced some interesting results. As varied as the ten weapons are, there's also an alternate method of firing each of them (the 8-Ball Launcher, Unreal's equivalent of a rocket launcher, can also be used as a grenade launcher). This wide range of attack styles will undoubtedly produce higher degrees of strategy in deathmatch play. As for single-player, the weapon placement and location was spaced out evenly, and finding ammunition was not a daunting task. <P> One of Unreal's best features is the enemy AI. In other games, the logic of certain creature actions seems to be linear and undefined. In Unreal, each opponent attacks with its own style, using a combination of melee and ranged attacks. One of the most impressive experiences (if not the most aggravating) was seeing a well-placed rocket shot miss because a Skaarj dodged it at the last second. Another eye-catching sight was watching different enemies power up shields to protect themselves in the midst of battle. <P> As far as problems go, there are some, but they don't hurt gameplay enough to reduce the overall experience. The first is that there are too few enemy model types. Unreal has only six main enemy models, but the design team has done a pretty good job of using different skins to create a variety of opponents. In addition, there are other models for the random critters that you fight throughout your adventuring. <P> Another complaint deals with the pace of gameplay. Sometimes the pace of action seems too stretched out, and it feels as if each battle is just the same as the last. However, these gaps were few, and for the most part the game pacing and plot development were enjoyable. On the puzzle-solving side, there isn't much to be had; most of the game you simply push buttons to open a path leading to the next level. But your actions involving them are well integrated into the plot. There are few complex puzzles to solve; it's doubtful that Unreal would benefit from more in that area. <P> Lastly, the weapons are pretty cool, but there's no simplicity in design. Each gun takes some practice to understand its use and benefits, but in the end, you spend too much time learning. Rather than give you instinctual weapons (like a basic shotgun or machine gun), Unreal's unusual weaponry forces you to adjust the way you play, without much added benefit of weapon ferocity or visceral gratification. <P> If you're looking to hone your deathmatch skills, however, you're going to find playing online to be next to impossible. The developers have stated in the readme.txt file that the game is still in the tweaking phase as far as Internet play is concerned. But with seemingly boundless game customizability options as well as in-package deathmatch levels, Unreal gives you everything you need to practice for the big time. It even gives you a choice of bots designed by Steve Polge to test your mettle. This was probably one of the most enjoyable features, and after you've finished the game you can go in and set up your own games for a single-player deathmatch experience. <P> Unreal is a truly great single-player game. It's hard to say whether it will stand the test of the first-person action-shooter wars and become a classic in and of itself. It will definitely have to overcome the lack of a decent Internet experience if it wants to obtain any more accolades, but, apart from that, it offers as much as you could possibly want from a game in this genre. <I>--Tahsin Shamma</I><BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

920,Blood 2: The Chosen - PC,"['The original Blood won numerous fans, despite the fact that it was a 2D shooter released nearly a year after Quake made 3D environments standard. The clever level design and wisecracking antihero, Caleb, made up for the fact that the game was a technical throwback. Now, just over a year after the original hit stores, Monolith Productions has released a sequel. Based on Monolith\'s own LithTech engine, Blood II: The Chosen features some strong technical elements. The engine provides solid graphics (better than Quake II, not as good as Unreal), decent control, and great animation. But Blood II lacks some of the innovation of the original; the horror-theme is less pronounced, and the level design doesn\'t stray far from the average. <P> Blood II is excellent in several respects. Most of the weapons look and sound great, with the most notable example being the shotgun, which looks menacing and sounds even more so. The howitzer is also noteworthy, while the submachine gun looks bland, though it sounds good. On the low end of the spectrum is the Die Bug Die, a powerful insect repellent that neither looks nor sounds like it should be one of the more powerful weapons. There is a wide variety of weapons, and because you can only hold ten at a time, you must occasionally discard some. It\'s a nice feature, and one that lets you tailor your arsenal to your liking. <P> The animations are another high point in Blood II. Enemies move smoothly and look great. They die in a variety of ways, and you\'ll undoubtedly be struck the first time you see a human writhing on the ground after a grievous gut wound. On the downside, Blood II\'s artificial intelligence leaves something to be desired. Enemies usually won\'t attack until you come right into their line of sight and occasionally won\'t respond when attacked. The AI is better than in the first release of Shogo: Mobile Armor Division, Monolith\'s other LithTech-based shooter, but it\'s still nowhere near the level of Half-Life\'s believable enemy behavior. <P> Blood II looks impressive. The levels feature diverse appearances and spectacular colored lighting. The textures are great, and areas such as a tenement building and a museum are amazingly detailed. The levels themselves are diverse as well. In the first chapter alone, you\'ll travel from an ornate museum to a huge science facility to the alleys of an ominious city street to a futuristic flying machine. The game sounds just as good, with funny wisecracks, great ambient sounds, and an appropriately dark, techno soundtrack. <P> The major problem with Blood II is its pacing. Despite how good the levels look, they are at times confusing, with a variety of similar-looking corridors. Blood II uses a very traditional level design philosophy, and the need to find keys and push buttons is abundant. The designers are self-consciously aware of this, including jokes such as a mission briefing that tells you to push some buttons and kill some things, and a huge glowing sign advertising ""silver key industries."" Still, making jokes about it doesn\'t really help. Worse, you\'ll often go back through levels you\'ve already been through, arriving at any number of dead ends until you find the new path that has opened since your last visit. And while Blood II offers a variety of weapons and enemies, they are unevenly distributed, giving way to long stretches of the game in which you face the same group of monsters with the same group of weapons. <P> Blood II is by no means bad. In single-player, it is on par with Quake II, but lacking the innovation of Jedi Knight or Half-Life. Multiplayer with the LithTech engine still suffers from some of Shogo\'s latency problems, but the wide variety of weapons should make for some good deathmatching when Monolith gets those problems fixed. It\'s hard not to feel that Blood II is a step back in light of Half-Life; there\'s little sense of urgency, drama, or excitement. But it\'s hard to fault Blood II for not doing anything new; it sets out to be a traditional shooter and does a good, if not great, job. <i>--Ron Dulin</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

It's chaos in space as you destroy asteroids with smart bombs, ramming shields, and gun satellites."", 'If the continual revolution of gaming were instead a Maoist revolution, some of us reactionaries would be put to death. ""When I was your age, we played Tomb Raider with real tombs."" But it\'s true. When I was a kid I couldn\'t wait for technology to advance to the point where Pac-Man ate real food, and the worker droids of M.U.L.E. delivered precious ores to my door if I won. Oddly, rather than harnessing new technologies for a teleologically perfect Pong, developers have for the most part spent their time coming up with entirely new kinds of games. And imperfect classics like the vector graphics-driven Asteroids were buried, first by side scrollers, then by 3D. <P> With Asteroids, Activision is attempting to satisfy the crotchety old man in all of us by bringing the old game back to the future with the core of its gameplay intact. And Asteroids succeeds in doing just that. This is definitely Asteroids. Lots of big rocks. One tiny ship that reappears on the left when you exit stage right. This is 2D folks, despite the 3D look of the spinning asteroids and miscellaneous debris. And while the rocks do look prettier, and the black background has been replaced with various handsome nebulae and a panorama of space dust (didn\'t they figure out that stuff was actually ice?), the gameplay itself is faithful to the original and in no way iconoclastic. The basic controls are the same as in the original. It\'s simple: rotate (left and right), thrust, shields, a 180-degree flip, fire, and hyperspace. Come to think of it, that sounds like a lot for 1979. At any rate, then and now it was (and is) a simple but effective recipe for blistered fingers. Rather than alter the Space Colonel\'s original recipe, Activision has opted to simply outfit Asteroids with gobs of bells and whistles. That sounds like a mistake, but it\'s not, and gameplay is only enriched for the power windows and fuel injection. There are more enemy ships, but they\'re still more cute than threatening. Special asteroids, like the regenerating Crystal Asteroids and the aptly named Indestructible Asteroid, make for an interesting diversion. The environment is made slightly more rocky with the advent of black holes (mild ones that suck you a little ways toward your doom) and stars that occasionally spurt deadly hydrogen gas. By far the coolest addition to the formula is the inclusion of power-ups. Lots of them. Ramming shields, homing missiles, smart bombs, and my favorite, the GunSat, a gun turret that orbits your craft, blasting indiscriminately and blocking incoming objects. There are dozens of different power-ups, and they\'re all very cool. <P> Though not much to look at when compared with most of today\'s games, one can\'t help but feel like anything flashier would have altered the game\'s feel or, worse yet, its play mechanics. That said, the ships aren\'t much to look at, though the simplicity of your primary weapon\'s tiny green dots of light is nicely understated. The sound of the original is echoed here rather tastefully: Enemy craft still sound oddly like tiny alien police sirens, and asteroids burst asunder with a reasonable and modest crunch. One thing I could never figure out about the original stand-up: For a game about battling giant, potentially world-destroying boulders, why did everything feel so tiny? That cuteness is in full force in the remake and somehow makes some kind of cosmic sense. <P> It\'s great that somebody is remaking old games and making them better, rather than just licensing names and tacking them onto non sequitur first-person shooters. Activision has a winner here. Asteroids is 100 percent true to the feel of the original, with terrific new power-ups to spice things up. Though not likely to make anyone quit his day job - how many times could anyone want to clear another screen of debris? - it\'s fun to give a damn about high scores again. <I>--Josh Smith</I> <BR><I>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

922,Micro Machines 1 &amp; 2: Twin Turbo,"['This game gives new meaning to the phrase ""Take two, they\'re small."" <I>Micro Machines 1 &amp; 2: Twin Turbo</I> literally gives you two games on one cartridge. This is an unconventional arcade-style racer where the tiny vehicles are seen from a top-down perspective. There are no pit stops to plan for, nor is there oil pressure for you to worry about--just motorized mayhem on a miniature scale. Identical in gameplay, each game in <I>Micro Machines 1 &amp; 2: Twin Turbo</I> offers 24 unique tracks that, from your microperspective, seem enormous! You\'ll race around gigantic breakfast tables, bathtubs, desks, and gardens. With simple gameplay and quirky, colorful graphics, this game should appeal to gamers of all ages.', 'If history is any indication, Codemasters\' Micro Machines series is going to be with us for a long time. Name any game system, and chances are it\'s had a Micro Machines title on it. The NES original was a triumph of gameplay and quality, and it transferred well to the black-and-white Game Boy a few years later. In the 16-bit days, the libraries of the SNES and the Genesis were graced by a Micro Machines title as well. Even in this age of ""modern"" gaming, the glitz and glamour required by next-generation games have been kind to the series, resulting in two enjoyable PlayStation releases. Now, THQ brings the series back to its roots in the Game Boy Color version of Micro Machines 1 and 2: Twin Turbo. You read correctly, two games for the price of one. Those who\'ve been playing the Micro Machines series since the beginning will recognize this game, since it\'s basically a colorized update of the two prior Game Boy releases, only without the flicker and slowdown. For those new to the series, Micro Machines 1 and 2 is a top-down arcade-style racing game honoring Galoob\'s lovable minivehicles. After choosing your driver, you zoom along track after track of surreal raceways, such as a breakfast table, a bathtub, a pool table, or even a child\'s desk. The first game on the cartridge, Micro Machines, has 24 bizarrely unique tracks to race on, while the second, Micro Machines 2: Twin Turbo offers up an additional 24 for your racing pleasure. Other than the second title\'s larger sprites, both games play identical to each other: Press A to accelerate, press B to back up/decelerate, and use the D-Pad to steer your car. Driving is responsive, the difficulty is balanced, and the gameplay is as noncomplex as can be. In fact, the only visible flaws in each title\'s gameplay are those that have been with the series from the beginning: Recovery from crashes in the first game is far too lengthy, while the increased sprite size of the second game makes everything a bit difficult to react to. Though worthy of mention, these flaws are minor in effect, and only the most nitpicky of gamers will find themselves annoyed by them. Oddly enough, one of the flaws that had been fixed in the previous Game Boy version of Micro Machines is back in this release. The two-player mode is not a link-cable-style mode. Instead, player one must use the D-Pad to steer, and player two must use the A and B buttons, while both cars accelerate forward at top speed. Even though this setup preserves the sanctity of the original NES release, it relegates two-player matches to the realm of novelty rather than utility. Additionally, with the amount of courses available, the presence of a save feature (password or otherwise) would have been nice. Twenty-four courses is a bit much to complete in a sitting. As it stands though, these flaws don\'t detract from the overall quality of gameplay, but both games would have been more enjoyable had these concerns been addressed. Speaking of quality and enjoyment, do you like vibrant, well-drawn graphics? How about sound and music that make for an enjoyable gaming experience? If so, Micro Machines 1 and 2: Twin Turbo aims to please. Somehow, developer On-line has managed to re-create every detail and touch of the Codemasters\' original within the confines of the GBC\'s 160x144 resolution. School binders look like binders, oranges look like juicy oranges, and eating utensils look just like real forks and spoons. That sentence alone should convey how quirky and wonderful the game\'s graphics are. However, for those who focus on minor details, the presence of dust particles, explosions, and parallax scrolling ought to please even the most jaded gamer. Even the GBC\'s oft-maligned speaker sees superb use throughout the game. The music is trippy and engaging, engine sounds fit the miniaturized vehicles perfectly, and crash-and-spill sound effects almost make one think the game has a rumble feature. Sure, the sound is sparse at times, but it never comes across as tinny or scratchy. Unlike recent games that attempt to imitate the gameplay and style of Micro Machines, Micro Machines 1 and 2: Twin Turbo proves that nothing can improve on a series that neared perfection to begin with. Not only that, but you get two games for the price of one with this release, making for an unregrettable purchase.<i>--Frank Provo</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

923,A Bug's Life,"[""Straight from the hit Disney computer-animated movie, A BUG'S LIFE comes to the Game Boy Color. Play as the young ant Flik as he races through nine levels of varied action in his quest to save his ant colony from the cruel Hopper and his gang of grasshoppers. Hopper is bent on stealing all of the ants' food and destroying the colony. Fortunately, Flik is creative and has a few plans to help his friends. On the flip side, he's also very accident-prone, so not all of his plans work out. Play through the levels collecting parts to assemble his inventions while avoiding enemies and natural obstacles. Grasshoppers aren't the only bugs out to stop Flik, as he will also encounter bees, worms, wasps, and others. His only defenses against these nasty bugs are his throwing arm and a limited supply of berries. Never fear though, because scattered throughout the levels are more berries of the throwing variety and the health-giving variety. Just when things look their darkest, Flik can count on his insect friends to make the save!!! You've tried real-life; now try living A BUG'S LIFE."", ""Pixar's display CGI mastery made for a worthy couple of hours spent at the cinema, but how does the scaled-down version stack up? Better than you would think, although that doesn't guarantee a stellar gameplay experience. Handheld conversions of popular movies typically end up being pretty boring, and, while not reaching yawn-inducing limits, A Bug's Life doesn't prove to be that different from the rest. The storyline, of course, follows that of the Disney movie pretty closely. The evil Hopper is terrorizing a peaceful colony of ants, so worker ant Flik sets off to find some warriors to combat these bullies. How does THQ translate the ensuing comedy and excitement to the Game Boy? By making a side-scrolling platformer, of course. What were you expecting - Half-Life? Stages are based on key moments from the movie, including Princess Dot's rescue, wandering around the city, and the final battle with Hopper himself, all of which are guaranteed to drive hard-core Bug's Life fans into a frenzy... if there are any, that is. Using the Color hardware, A Bug's Life looks pretty good. It's not up to Super Mario Bros. DX's level of vibrancy, but it does the job. Backgrounds can get pretty drab and repetitive, though this may be the only way Tiertex has managed to make the levels so huge. Flik himself animates in an above average way and still manages to look like a bug-eyed version of Dave Foley. With the exception of Dim, the educationally impaired rhino, other characters are annoyingly small and badly visualized. The best treats for your eyeballs come in the form of the bridging cinema scenes, which use the movie's rendered style quite well. On a standard Game Boy or even a Super Game Boy, however, these screens lack flair and animation. Gameplay-wise, there's little to mention while remaining positive. We can handle a game being extremely simple if it's meant for younger players, but not when the controls are as fiddly and cumbersome as this. Some leaps require dumb luck to be made, rather than player skill. Berries used for ammunition can also hurt you, depending on what speed their traveling. If that sounds stupid to you, that's because it is. On the plus side, the design occasionally strays from the side-scrolling formula, with harvesting and flying levels to cherish and enjoy for all eternity or until the batteries run out. There's nothing really wrong with A Bug's Life, but the whole game never really manages to become anything more than eventually forgettable.<i>--Cameron Davis</i>--<i>Copyright  1998 GameSpot Inc.

924,Toy Story 2,"[""Everybody's favorite celebrity toys are playing in a new adventure on the Game Boy, based on the Disney/Pixar feature film of the same name. In <i>Toy Story 2</i>, players such as Buzz Lightyear go nearly to infinity and beyond, through a variety of levels filled with obstacles and tasks, to rescue Woody from the hands of a crooked toy collector. Hamm, Rex, and Slinky Dog lend a helping hand, as do new faces from <i>Toy Story 2</i>: Jessie the cowgirl, the Prospector, and Bull's-eye, the toy horse."", 'Kids help heroic Buzz Lightyear rescue Woody from the nasty toy collector in this Game Boy arcade game. There are 10 scenes or levels to get Buzz through, each with its own obstacles and power sources. Although the game play essentially comes down to the relatively brainless activity of trying to earn points by flying through coins, batteries and air blasts, there\'s also a fair amount of novelty built in. In one scene, Buzz rides Bullseye the Horse to hop aboard a plane. In another scene, Buzz goes up an elevator to get to Al\'s apartment. You won\'t find any violence or worrisome content- Buzz only uses his laser gun to slow down Rex and other critters- and while testers struggled at times, on the whole, they were enthusiastic.<br /><b>Teaches: </b>game play, logic <br /><b>Age Range: </b>5-up Copyright  2000 Children\'s Software Revue -- <i><a href=""https://secure.tradenet.net/childrenssoftware/csroffer.html"">From Children\'s Software Revue -- ""Subscribe Now!""</a></i><br /><br />Toy Story 2 follows the film of the same name. After Woody is kidnapped by a greedy toy collector, Buzz Lightyear and his friends set out to rescue him in a side-scrolling platformer that takes them from Andy\'s bedroom to Al\'s apartment to an airport and back to home sweet home. Because Woody is incapacitated during most of the movie (and in the game), Buzz Lightyear has to do all the work. You can only control Buzz - but that\'s not necessarily a bad thing, given that he can shoot lasers out of his wrists and ""fall with style."" The gameplay is pretty simplistic, with Buzz running and jumping from left to right and climbing beds, bookshelves, airport chairs, and the like while collecting keys, batteries, and power-ups as he races across town to rescue Woody. Like in the Pixar film, Buzz is extremely well drawn: His jumping and climbing animations are very fluid and smooth. Many of the other toys in the game weren\'t given the same care, as they simply walk back and forth relentlessly, waiting for a zap from your laser to put them out of their misery. The background graphics (consisting mostly of posters and other toy memorabilia) occasionally blend too well with the foreground graphics, leading you to wonder if they can be interacted with. The sound and music are standard Game Boy fare: nothing fancy, but nothing wrong either. Where the game suffers is in its control scheme. If the designers had done their homework and played the original Super Mario Bros. game they would have realized that it\'s never a good idea to make the jump button the same as the run button. When B is tapped Buzz jumps; when it is held down, he runs; when it\'s held down without the directional cross he jumps repeatedly. This leads to stuttering animations when you\'re trying to negotiate tight platforms, and it forbids any Mario-esque long-distance hurdles that require timing and technique. Fortunately, the game\'s obstacles never require much skill to negotiate, and most players will blast though this title on their first try. <i>--Doug Trueman</i>--<i>Copyright  1998 GameSpot Inc.

927,Yoot Tower,"['Yoot Tower for Mac turns you loose with towers. This is the simulation/strategy sequel to SimTower, and the towers can get as complex as you want.', ""Yoot Tower, the sequel to the classic SimTower, is here for all you aspiring real estate moguls. Thought you could never afford your own three-star luxury hotel on Waikiki? How about one at Kegon Falls in Japan? Or what about a world-class tower right in the middle of Tokyo, where real estate prices are astronomical? If you like simulations and to-die-for properties, you'll like the highly enjoyable Yoot Tower, which comes complete with please-us-or-we-leave-you tenants. <P>At first glance, Yoot Tower's graphics don't dazzle - they're pretty similar to  those of SimTower, albeit more refined. Don't expect an isometric point of view: You see everything straight on in a cutaway view. Yoot Tower won't attract gamers with its sound, either - there's no sweeping soundtrack replete with orchestral stirrings and bravado. On the other hand, you shouldn't let this title's simple graphics and sound stop you from getting into the simulation. <P>In Yoot Tower you have one basic goal: Keep all tenants, tourists, and visiting VIPs happy and stress free. If your guests run into bad service or inadequate facilities, they'll leave and never come back. Then you get stuck with vacancies and not enough revenue to keep your tower in tip-top shape. Also, if you hope to raise your rating from one to two or three stars, you'd better please those inspectors. <P>Yoot Tower is thoroughly enjoyable for the widest audience of gamers. Its ease of use and low system requirements will appeal to casual players, while sim veterans will relish controlling all the variables and parameters to produce an efficient, self-sustaining microcosm. For example, you can set Yoot Tower to a slow speed and a minimal population. In fact, it's a good idea to start off small and raise revenue for building-expansion projects. On the other end of the spectrum, you can put the game in high gear and expand your domain quickly, tower by tower, just as Napoleon took on country after country following the French Revolution. Don't get too ambitious with suites and condos, though, or you'll be facing belligerent tenants in a real estate Waterloo. <P>Yoot Tower may sound easy to play, but once you construct a tower whose population climbs into the thousands (that can mean 8,000 or more), managing your property becomes quite challenging. It demands not only multitasking, but also attention to individual rooms, event halls, restaurants, and transportation systems. You must accept accidents and natural disasters as part of the deal, too. Recovery from fires or terrorist bombings requires the strategic placement of security offices in your tower - not to mention the all-important housekeeping units, which keep your castle free of creepy-crawlies. <P>In sum, Yoot Tower is a terrific simulation that lets you control just how much you want to control in your universe.

Once you have the perfect wrestler, you can battle in seven different game modes: Challenge, Career, King of the Ring, Versus, Tag Team, Cage Match, and Training. Are you tough enough to challenge all of the wrestlers in the WWF? Play WWF ATTITUDE and find out.', 'While WWF Attitude is one of the most anticipated games around on the console systems, everyone seemingly forgot that Acclaim was also doing a Game Boy Color (and only Game Boy Color - the game won\'t play on older GBs) version. However, that may very well be because this game is easily forgettable, offering little to no challenge and very little variance between its characters.  The game\'s high point has to be the modes, which range from your typical one-on-one contests and quests (including career mode and king-of-the-ring contests) to tag team matches and cage matches. There\'s also a training room, where you can practice strategy and test your moves against a dummy opponent, but the game is so simplistic that you needn\'t spend more than five to ten minutes getting a feel for the game.  While the game is extremely simple to pick up and master, it still manages to be a better game than most of Acclaim\'s previous WWF titles for the Game Boy, offering a wider selection of wrestlers and a much, much better graphical presentation. The game\'s also got most of the wrestlers\' finishing moves in there, though unlike the moves in the console versions of Attitude, here you just grapple your opponent and hit select and A at the same time. The game also really lacks any kind of pre- or post-match information. You\'re given a simple vs. screen before every match, and after every match in career mode you\'re spit back out to the ranking ladder, where your password is given. A simple ""Your winner is..."" screen really would have gone a long way here. Also, the game repeats the same music track endlessly throughout its title screens and matches. You\'ll definitely want to save some battery life (not to mention your ears) by turning the volume all the way down.  A link-cable multiplayer option really could have saved WWF Attitude. As a single-player game, it really doesn\'t offer much in the way of longevity. The AI is prone to far too many not-so-devious tricks and fails to put up a decent fight on even the hardest difficulty setting. It\'s better than the wrestling games to come before it, but it still doesn\'t quite get the job done. <i>--Jeff Gerstmann</i>--<i>Copyright  1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

936,Yoda Stories,"['Grab your lightsaber, young Jedi, and get ready for <i>Star Wars</i> adventuring in <i>Yoda Stories</i>. Assume the role of Luke Skywalker as he trains with Yoda to become a Jedi Knight. Harness the Force and travel across the galaxy to collect devices and weapons, and battle fearsome enemies. Yoda will guide you through 10 levels and many puzzle-based missions where you will meet exotic aliens, explore maps, and deal the Galactic Empire one crippling blow after another.', 'The annals of history are thick with lackluster Star Wars games. Although exceptional releases such as Dark Forces, Force Commander, and Jedi Knight serve as examples of positive gaming experiences, the majority of Star Wars titles better resemble the thud you hear when someone\'s on the receiving end of a Mike Tyson uppercut. Given this history, two possibilities exist for THQ\'s Game Boy Color release of Yoda Stories. It could either be a satisfying work of art or a festering pile of human waste. Approximately ten seconds into the game, the phrase ""work of art"" leaps to mind. Groovy caricatures of Yoda and Luke get the story off on the right foot, while initial glances at the top-down action-RPG levels give one the hope of a Zelda-like experience. Unfortunately, one second after providing Luke with forward momentum, the game\'s similarities to a dung heap become clear. Instead of animating smoothly, Luke progresses one square at a time, interacting with objects and enemies from eight possible directions. But Luke can only face in four directions! Because of this, pushing boxes or other objects is a chore, since Luke has a tendency to walk around anything he touches. Furthermore, battling Stormtroopers or sand people is nigh impossible, mostly due to the fact that they tend to circle around Luke as you wildly flail a poorly executed lightsabre. Yoda Stories is reminiscent of a Tiger LCD game, and each of its 15 levels plays just as bad, if not worse, than one of those $5 castaways. Though the storyline flows fairly well, getting through it is a major pain, as Luke\'s entire mission is to wander hinter and yon, gathering objects that can be traded for more objects, all in an effort to act out various aspects of the Star Wars myth. Repetition is quick to set in, enemies are lacking in variety, and about the only bright spot to the gameplay is that the difficulty level is low. As if the poor control and lackluster gameplay weren\'t enough, the game delivers a visual experience akin to that of a Viewmaster toy. In fact, it\'s quite possible that a Viewmaster could deliver better animation and visuals than Yoda Stories. Though still images give the impression that the game will look decent, the truth is that the lack of colors, the animation, and the severe sprite repetition serve as an all-out affront to one\'s senses. Luke animates with only two or three frames per movement, nonplayer characters with even less, and backgrounds are as stagnant as Mexican well water. Speaking of backgrounds, though the game offers a plethora of locations, each one is rendered from a minimal stock of four templates. Admittedly, they\'re drawn acceptably, but one or two screen\'s worth of locales, and you\'ll be begging to be put down from constant feelings of deja vu. There aren\'t even any cutscenes to reward the diligent player who completes each level. Even Nintendo\'s Game &amp; Watch series, which Yoda Stories resembles, has cutscenes and picture galleries! Further deepening the torture, the game\'s audio simply begs to be silenced. Weapon and interaction sounds are decent, but the major lack of variety quickly makes them an unwelcome occurrence. Similarly, the game\'s background music is appropriate, but since a new one doesn\'t kick in until you reach a later level, gut-wrenching repetition sets in quickly. You can only listen to the first 20 seconds of the Star Wars theme just so much. It\'s an understatement to say that not since Kickle Cubicle has sound in a video game been so blah and uninspiring. Sadly, there is no reason for anyone to play through Yoda Stories. The storyline is one that Star Wars fans already know; the gameplay is below that of Quest for Camelot; and better graphics and sound exist in 20-year-old Colecovision games. Furthermore, the game\'s password save system requires you to reach the end of a level before it offers you the ability to rejoin the quest, almost forcing a person to play the game. If THQ, Torus, and Lucasfilm are lucky, people will forget this stinker quickly. Yoda Stories is quite possibly the worst Star Wars video game ever produced.<i>--Frank Provo</i>--<i>Copyright  1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

With over 150 different offensive and defensive plays, the playing style of each team can be recreated. Put on a helmet and get ready for some football with MADDEN NFL 2000."", ""Madden 2000 is the latest in the long and seemingly never-ending list of sports games that EA churns out for every platform in existence (well, except the Dreamcast). In its latest effort for the Game Boy Color, the wizards at THQ and Tiertex have managed to squeeze almost all the cool features into the Game Boy. It's quite a feat, really. As you can on the home systems, you can choose from any of the current NFL teams and set up your own seasons, playoffs, exhibition games, and even sudden-death matches, where the first team to score wins. The depth and attention to detail that have been present in many of the previous Madden titles are here as well: You can call audibles, substitute players, fake field goals, reverse plays, and make onside kicks. Controlling the players is a snap: The two buttons handle everything from choosing receivers to making diving catches, and it's all done intuitively. You can also adjust game time and weather - a sudden-death match in the cold winter snow is good for a laugh. The Madden AI is no slouch either. Although I made almost all of my passing plays on the first try, the CPU will punish you if you fall asleep on the bench, and the computer mixes up its plays quite well (though the Buffalo Bills seemed to always choke on third down). The graphics are clear and crisp, and the game briefly pauses whenever the ball is thrown so that you can easily find the ball on the screen and respond accordingly. Players who score touchdowns even do a brief celebratory dance. Fans of portable gaming who generally dislike sports titles should give Madden 2000 a try: The control is dead-on, the graphics are clean, and there are enough options to keep you tossing the pigskin around for a long time.<i>--Doug Trueman</i>--<i>Copyright  1998 GameSpot Inc.

942,Total Annihilation - PC,"['In Total Annihilation, you are a commander who can build an entire complex war. You can manipulate matter at an atomic level--but so can your enemy. Find a way to conquer the enemy and end the threat to universal existence. Battle with realistic firing cannons and nukes on diverse terrain, including canyons and molten riverbeds. Total Annihilation challenges you to set a new standard for combat strategy.', 'The gaming industry is gearing up to bury consumers under an avalanche of real-time strategy games. Every developer is touting the one or two features that will help its game to ""redefine the genre"" - but the majority of these features do nothing but take away from the precarious balance which made the big two - Warcraft II and Command &amp; Conquer - such runaway hits. At first glance, Total Annihilation, with its much ballyhooed 3D terrain and more than ten dozen units, appears to be nothing more than another in a long line of real-time games with a few minor innovations. But in this case, the innovations work. Cavedog has done a commendable job of taking the basic mechanics of real-time strategy and using them to create something new: A game that relies less on constant mouse-clicking than careful planning and strategic thinking.', 'Initial impressions of Total Annihilation may be misleading. Fire up a campaign and the first few missions will seem like nothing more than another Command &amp; Conquer clone, albeit one with strikingly realistic terrain and a great symphonic score. But as you play deeper into the game, or play a few multiplayer battles or skirmish missions where your opponent is less forgiving, the complexities of the game begin to become apparent. Total Annihilation is a game about balance, from the tightly interwoven resource management scheme to the very diverse units.', ""It's hard to talk about one without the other, and resource management provides a great tightrope you must walk to keep the army strong, both in numbers and brute force. You need the two resources in the game (metal and energy) to power and build your units. Unfortunately, metal is usually rather scarce in the early parts of a mission (later you can salvage wreckage from destroyed units), but you can build generators to convert energy to metal. This solution to the metal shortage poses another problem entirely: Your units need energy to fire their weapons, and these generators use a great deal of power to produce a small amount of metal. Building a massive army of units is fine, but won't help you much if you don't have enough energy to keep them firing."", 'The units themselves - robotic mechs, vehicles, aircraft, and naval vessels - provide more to the balancing challenge. The stronger units are devastating but require a great deal of power and move very slowly. Large tanks and ships take a great deal of time to simply turn and fire at a target, and large bombers often must traverse the entire length of a map to turn around and make a second run. As a result, you must create balanced forces, small units to hold the enemy while the big guns ready themselves. There\'s no ""ultimate weapon"" like Red Alert\'s Mammoth Tank or Warcraft II\'s Ogre Magi - there are only more powerful weapons that have equally powerful disadvantages. And then there\'s the Commander, your strongest unit, your fastest builder and possessor of the devastating D-Gun that destroys units with a single shot. The Commander provides another great strategic conundrum - he\'s your best warrior, but it\'s risky to send him into battle because once the Commander\'s gone, the mission is over.', 'Total Annihilation is full of great features. The 3D terrain - pre-rendered maps with tall mountains and deep valleys - plays an important part in strategy, as units situated at higher elevations have a much wider firing range. Units can take cover behind trees, but these trees - and whole forests - can go up in flames with a single stray shot. When units are destroyed, complete with bass-heavy explosions and a slight shaking of the map, shrapnel flies everywhere, and structures and troops unlucky enough to be hit by the flying debris take damage, adding to the need for strategic placement - just standing and firing at the enemy will cause your units to get destroyed very quickly.', ""Your units gain experience, and with five kills they become veterans with much more accurate firing ability. You can also give units numerous commands at once (simply by holding down the shift key), so that minor tasks can be queued while you go off to worry about more important matters. These types of details make Total Annihilation great, and every time you play you'll discover some subtle little feature that makes you want to change your tactics and try something new."", ""There are a few small details that could have been improved. The opening missions of the Core campaign are set on a metallic backdrop that is somewhat confusing, making the area in your line of sight and grayed-out; invisible areas look very similar. The manual is a little on the skimpy side, and the lack of any tutorial to demonstrate the game's mechanics seems like an oversight, especially in a game where many players will bring tried-and-true real-time tactics, only to find they're almost completely useless. There's also the lack of a dedicated server for Internet play and the noticeable lack of a scenario editor. Finally, there's the Commander AI bug, which makes the enemy AI send his Commander into battle early on in skirmish missions, causing most to only last a few minutes (Cavedog has promised that a patch for this problem will be released shortly)."", ""But in the face of all that is right about Total Annihilation, these minor details are fairly easily overlooked. If you're looking for a real-time strategy game that adds some new features without breaking from the standard formula, Total Annihilation may be too foreign to satisfy your needs. But if you're looking for a game that is challenging and rewarding on entirely new levels, Total Annihilation is highly recommended. <i>--Ron Dulin</i> <br />--<i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc.

943,Croc 2 - PC,"['This game introduces Croc as a crusading crocodile who must rescue his friends, the Gobbos, from the evil villain Baron Dante. Baron Dante has taken over the Gobbo Valley and is turning all good creatures to evil with his magical powers. With amazing graphics and animation, including moves such as swimming, swinging, and flying, you can explore with Croc in more than 250 individual game areas on 45 levels.', ""Originally released for the PlayStation, Croc 2 is the sequel to a generally forgettable 3D platform game from 1997. As could be expected, the developers at Argonaut have improved virtually every aspect of the original Croc for the sequel: The levels are larger, many new subgames have been included, and the visuals are more complex and colorful. Unfortunately, as was the case when the original Croc was released, similar games such as Spyro the Dragon 2 and Rayman 2 have already set the current standard for excellence in the genre. And in comparison with those games, Croc 2 is a competently executed but uninspired also-ran. <P> Croc 2 adheres to the 3D platform structure introduced by Super Mario 64. You guide a cute character through a series of connected hub worlds, each containing a number of areas and tasks that must be completed to advance to the next world. Each level contains optional items that can be collected to unlock secret areas and power-ups. To accomplish these goals, Croc can jump, butt-stomp, swim, climb, and ride various vehicles such as the old genre standby, the mine cart, and six others, including a giant snowball. <P> In the absence of any great innovation, Croc 2 needs to get by on its production values. The graphics and sound are good but not especially memorable. Croc 2 is 3D accelerated and supports all the latest visual gewgaws such as transparencies and lighting effects. Aside from some glaringly misaligned textures, there's really nothing to complain about. The design is adequate to convey an air of generic cartoon whimsy yet never really makes the game come to life in any kind of satisfying or surprising way. From the lava world to the ice world, you've seen all of Croc 2's sights many times before in other games. <P> Thanks to awkward controls, traversing Croc 2's unimaginatively eccentric environments is more trouble than it should be. Two different control schemes are available, but neither one is particularly successful. The first method lets you move Croc forward and backward and rotate him left and right by pressing the respective direction on the keyboard or joystick. Unless you tap quickly, the right and left turns end in a step forward, which can be disastrous in a tight situation or while attempting to line up a precise jump. The second method simply lets you turn and move Croc toward whatever direction you press. In this mode, there's no backpedaling. You have to press a separate key to do a 180-degree turn. Both control schemes are overly sensitive and take a long and often frustrating amount of time to master. Some of the early levels have timed tasks, and trying to learn the controls under the pressure of a time limit is often more maddening than fun. <P> Croc 2's developer, Argonaut Software, hasn't solved the camera problems that plague this type of game. The camera is often set too close to the main character and isn't always pointed at an angle suited to moving Croc from one place to another. At some points in the game, generally whenever you're forced to make precise jumps in a tight corridor, it's almost impossible to complete the maneuvers without missing. The camera also lags behind you when you turn, which makes it overly difficult to quickly perform a sequence of jumps at right angles to each other. The game supports a free-look in the form of a pair of binoculars. Oddly, while it overlays a binocular cutout on the screen, nothing is actually magnified. Instead, there's simply less visible area, and you can only focus in a 180-degree arc around Croc. A more standard free-look would have been a better idea. <P> Croc 2 does include one unique option called omniplay, which lets you split the controls between two joysticks. For instance, one person can control the camera and jumping while another controls everything else. It's a good way to share the game experience with kids. <P> By the halfway point of Croc 2, you'll have learned to tolerate the controls, circumvent the camera, and make Croc do your bidding, more or less. The entire package is blandly professional enough and provides enough consistent gameplay to avoid outright dismissal, but it clearly lacks the imaginative spark necessary to make playing it a memorable experience. <BR>--<I>Erik Wolpaw</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;2000 GameSpot Inc.

944,Falcon 4.0,"['<i>Falcon 4.0</i> is an advanced and easy-to-use flight simulator. It is the only flight simulator with a completely real-time campaign, and it offers multiple levels of difficulty for novice and expert pilots alike.', ""Just when the Macintosh combat flight simulator market is growing stale, Falcon 4.0 flies onto the scene. Four years in the making, Falcon 4.0 sets a new standard for impressive visuals and realism. The graphics, physics, and multitude of functions achieve what the designers and developers set out to do: simulate an F-16. The premise of Falcon 4.0 is simple. Tensions in Korea have escalated to the point of war, and you're responsible for dispensing a healthy dose of justice. Your first task, though, is to master the controls of your F-16. Falcon 4.0's learning curve matches a 7G climb, and you're going to black out before you reach the end."", ""Thankfully, MacSoft ships several printed training guides, including a 400-page Flight Handbook, a map of Korea, and a chart of well over 100 keyboard commands. You'll greatly ap- preciate these references; it would be a nightmare to learn to fly the F-16 through PDF files."", ""The training manuals progressively expose you to all of the F-16's controls. The first section of the Flight Handbook is a companion to 31 simple tutorials. These missions begin with basic maneuvers and move on to all other aspects of the F-16. Lessons teach the functions of the interactive switches and dials in the cockpit and address the extensive radio system - you'll learn how to send commands to your wingman and how to find the nearest refueling tanker."", ""Falcon 4.0's graphics are a remarkable engineering feat. The terrain is a pleasing trade-off between photorealistic quality and designing the program to fit on one CD. Above 3,000 feet, the mountains and valleys are smooth. Close to the ground, square texture maps become visible, but they aren't distracting. The program also renders planes and other vehicles expertly. The hardware-accelerated graphics such as smoke trails, lens flares, and clouds are all gorgeous. The glass in the cockpit even reflects the surroundings, making it hard to grow tired of just looking around."", 'The physics in Falcon 4.0 round out the experience. The jets react very much in accordance with Newtonian physics. If you prefer arcade-style gameplay, you can trade realism for quick maneuverability and steer wherever you want without much concern for speed, weight, or gravity.', ""The game types in Falcon 4.0 are more diverse than in other flight sims. The options include Instant Action, Dogfight, and Campaign. Dogfight and Instant Action require little preparation - they place you in the middle of a fight. In the most planning-intensive mode, Campaign, you can select your missions, targets, and flight paths. You can also download missions other players have designed or create your own missions within the game. With all these different ways to play, it'll take hundreds of flights to even start to exhaust Falcon 4.0's possibilities."", ""The multiplayer features of Falcon 4.0 offer more variety than other simulators. For example, you aren't limited to dogfights in network play. Campaign mode is more fun with another player as your wingman or even as an enemy planning strikes against your base. However, the networking functions of Falcon 4.0 have some shortcomings. Internet battles work fairly well on a modem, but there's no simple way to find existing games. Another difficulty is that on LANs, Falcon 4.0 only supports TCP/IP connections, so AppleTalk users are out of luck."", ""Falcon 4.0 suffered from bugs in the earlier PC release, but fortunately the Mac version doesn't share these. Nevertheless, the porting company, Westlake Interactive, released a maintenance patch a few days after the game shipped. It's annoying to have to patch a shipping product, but in the games market, that's life. That said, the few bugs left after the update don't detract from gameplay."", ""As is common with cutting-edge games, the company understates Falcon 4.0's requirements. For the best performance, you need plenty of RAM, a G3, and a Rage 128 or Voodoo2 video card. In addition to high system requirements, Falcon 4.0 requires an InputSprocket-compatible joystick or flight stick. A true pilot wouldn't want to play with a mouse or keyboard."", ""Although Falcon 4.0 is merely a game, we like to think that it's the closest you'll get to climbing into an F-16 and flying the unfriendly skies at Mach speeds without becoming a real top gun. With its impressive visuals, realistic physics, and action-packed missions, Falcon 4.0 lets you engage MiGs, liberate nations, and win medals - and you can pause to take a breath once in a while. -- <i>Zack Stern</i>"", 'good news : Eye-candy overload.

A cooperative mode allows two players to tackle the  job together, and up to four players can compete in death match-style squishes... er, skirmishes. <i>--Eric  Twelker</i>', 'Acclaim Studios London must have noticed that MicroProse had neglected to properly exploit its license for last year\'s giant bug-filled sci-fi film Starship Troopers for the console systems, because the inspiration behind its latest game for the Nintendo 64 is crystal clear. Though the name of the game comes from a little-known Acclaim Comics property where a military unit possesses futuristic suits of armor along the lines of Marvel Comics\' Iron Man, the alien race that the group clashes with in Armorines is totally dissimilar to the one found in the comic book. However, the alien race bears more than a passing resemblance to the swarm of creatures found in Paul Verhoeven\'s recent cinematic ode to fascism.  Enough back story. Armorines is a first-person shooter in which you have two characters to choose from, one who is slow but powerful and another who moves and fires more quickly but isn\'t quite as sturdy. This choice of characters is the game\'s main innovation over Acclaim\'s Turok 2: Seeds of Evil, the game whose engine powers Armorines, which comes up very short in comparison. In fact, Armorines is, in many ways, all the things you didn\'t like about Turok 2 and little of what you did like.  The inventive weapons, well-designed monsters, and challenging enemy AI found in Turok 2 are all missing here, and the only scripted events you\'ll come across are an onrush of monsters after you\'ve opened a door or have acquired an item. Remember the big levels in Turok 2, where you had to backtrack for half an hour just to find a key or kidnapped child? Do you recall how your enemies disappeared after they died so you didn\'t have a clear indication if you\'d been in that area before? Both of those elements are well represented in Armorines, with a dash of unclear explanation of mission objectives tossed in for good measure. For example, in one of the jungle missions, you\'re charged with destroying 34 alien eggs before they hatch. Expect to run around the level for quite awhile, looking for the last batch of eggs, all the while wondering how many you have remaining because the only indication of your progress is an open checkbox on your mission list (indicating you haven\'t found them all and, likewise, completed the mission). ""What do I do now?"" and ""Which way am I supposed to go?"" are questions that come up far too often in this game. Armorines supports the Expansion Pak, which bumps up its graphics to high resolution without affecting the frame rate aversely. Unfortunately, the environments are very sparse and bland and appear much more like those found in the original Turok game than in its more impressive sequel. And while fog is not always present, draw-in appears quite often. Besides the in-game visuals, the game\'s presentation and interface are extremely lackluster and add to the impression that the title was rushed out the door for a holiday release. The audio side of Armorines is simply lousy. The soundtrack is made up of extremely short, rhythmic loops, while effects like walking on stone are represented with a sound like someone dribbling a basketball, and enemy death knells sound like a horse screaming in pain.  The multiplayer modes in Armorines aren\'t all bad, but they\'re not that great, either. A few basic alterations on the standard deathmatch are provided, and a decent frame rate is maintained. But the levels are very boring. It\'s hard to draw a bead on your foes, and all the little extras seen in other N64 games with multiplayer modes over the last few years fail to appear. However, a two-player cooperative version of the main game is offered, which does end up adding a lot of value to the title. One strong point isn\'t enough to save Armorines, though, with everything else just conspiring to make it feel like a bad Turok 2: Seeds of Evil clone. And since the developers couldn\'t put a ton of huge monstrous bugs onscreen at once because they\'d bog down the frame rate, Armorines is prevented from being the Starship Troopers bug hunt it so desperately wanted to be.<i>--Joe Fielder</i>--<i>Copyright &#169; 1998 GameSpot Inc.

947,Metal Gear Solid: VR Missions,"['<I>Metal Gear Solid</I> is one of the most successful, and maybe one of the best, PlayStation games ever. These virtual reality missions expand on the training of the special forces unit your character in <i>MGS</i> came from.', ""You, as the Virtual Reality embodiment of Solid Snake of <i>MGS</i> fame, can go through specific training for each of the weapons in <i>MGS</i>, combat simulators, and even a photo shoot. That's right, while you're working through the VR missions (most of which are mini-puzzles), your reward is that you get closer and closer to the game's female characters in a photo session. You can also unlock extra missions, eventually becoming able to play as a ninja."", 'The best part, though, is working through the higher level training missions, where the skills you thought you perfected in <i>MGS</i> are really put to the test. With 300 missions packed into this game, you better start training now. <i>--John Cocking</i>', '<b>Pros:</b> <ul> <li>Short levels mean you can play during your lunch hour</li> <li>More <I>Metal Gear Solid</I> action</li> <li>Combat training with plastic explosives</li> </ul> <b>Cons:</b> <ul> <li>Hierarchical progression of levels can bore expert players</li> <li>Mostly valuable as an add-on to <I>Metal Gear Solid</I></li> </ul>', 'Metal Gear Solid: the revolutionary game that invented its own genre. A game that redefined the way we imagine games and how we play them. As has been well documented, Metal Gear Solid is a game that focuses mainly on stealth. Stealth, as displayed by Solid Snake, is the greatest weapon you will have in the game. Haphazard gunfire and sloppy tactics will get you killed in this game. Period. If you want to make it out of this snowy hellhole in one piece, you\'d better learn when to act and when to stay still, and you\'d better learn quick. <P>What, then, is the point of Metal Gear Solid: VR Missions? Unlike the Japanese version (which released under the name MGS: Integral), the domestic version is not just a slightly updated version of the original game. The Japanese version only added the tuxedo from the original American release, along with a useless first-person perspective that was more trouble than it was worth. For the US version, MGS: VR Missions is essentially an extra disc, which, among other things, adds 300 additional VR missions for the stealthy gamers out there to occupy themselves with. That\'s right. At the risk of sounding like a used-car salesman, a staggering 300 VR missions awaits to test all of you who thought you were all that the first time around. Those of you who finish all these extra missions will be able to unlock special missions, such as ""mystery missions,"" where you must solve, um, mysteries, kind of like the Hardy Boys. You can also unlock bonus missions, where you can play as the ninja, which is particularly cool.  <P>The challenge level is fairly high, and it will take you a while to beat all 300 missions, which include nonweapon stealth missions, weapon missions, and more. Combined with the mystery modes and all the extra little things that MGS fans will appreciate, Metal Gear Solid: VR Missions gives you an extremely original collection of gaming goodness. <P>In addition to the extra VR missions is a photographic mode that, depending on your success and score in the regular game, will allow you increasingly closer access to the girls in the game. The higher your rating, the closer you can get to Mei Ling in a virtual photo shoot. Unfortunately, the photos still take up a shocking two memory card blocks each, making this a cost-prohibitive endeavor. However, if you\'re a budding stalkerazzi, then this may be the cherry on top. The game would have scored higher if it had come packed with the original game, but without it, it must simply be judged as an optional expansion pack for Metal Gear fans who crave a little more of that stealth action. Even so, with or without the original game, this is a worthy purchase for gamers who like a little meat with their potatoes. While it would have been a bit cooler as a complete set (but hey, you probably already own MGS, anyway), the VR missions belong in any MGS fan\'s library. --James Mielke <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.

948,NHL Championship 2000,"['With the unmatched level of control of NHL Championship 2000, use authentic player moves including wrist shots and slap slots. Get up close and personal with 3-D uniforms, and even respond to cross-checks by throwing down your gloves to have a rumble on the ice. With FOXTrax Puck Positioning System, see every shot on the goal and evaluate who your sharpshooters are. John Davidson and Kenny Albert announce play-by-play interactions for 28 real NHL teams and 18 international teams.', ""The average sports fan identifies hockey with blazing speed, smoking slapshots, and wild brawls. Because the more popular computer hockey games are designed with the average sports fan in mind rather than the serious hockey enthusiast, they come off as caricatures of the sport rather than realistic simulations. For the past several years, EA Sports has dominated the PC hockey world with its NHL series by producing games with great graphics and sound that are lots of fun to play. But some hard-core hockey fans have argued that EA Sports' hockey is more of an arcade game than an accurate simulation of the sport. With NHL Championship 2000, Fox Sports has created a fun game that gives serious hockey fans more of the realism they demand."", 'NHL Championship 2000 lets you experience the ""coolest game on earth"" by taking control of one of 28 teams in the National Hockey League or one of 18 international teams. Games can be played as single exhibitions, a season (short, medium, or long), or as a playoff series. World tournament mode is available for the international teams. As the coach, you can arrange your lines and special teams and make trades. You also have the ability to determine your team\'s style of play when it\'s on the attack or defense. The player editor lets you add players not on the roster or tweak player settings to make them perform the way you think they should.', ""NHL Championship 2000 isn't likely to turn the heads of those who place a high priority on sound and graphics. It also lacks the features (such as a career mode) and polish of NHL 2000, which does a better job of duplicating the atmosphere and excitement of a live hockey game. But for those who want a game that plays and feels more like real-life hockey, NHL Championship 2000 is the better choice."", ""That's not to say that the Fox Sports game is a dead-on accurate simulation of hockey. One of the game's most serious flaws is that line changes are so slow that attempting to change on the fly is an invitation for the opposition to score. Fortunately, it's usually not difficult to get a stop in play to make a change when you need it without having to ice the puck. Even then, waiting for the line-change animation to finish is irritatingly slow, which makes you long for NHL 2000's speed-game option. But unlike the EA Sports game, NHL Championship 2000 lets you change lines and defensive pairings separately."", ""In addition, the checking animations are ridiculous. Hard checks frequently send players flipping wildly through the air, making them look as if they belong in the WWF and not the NHL. Less-serious checks will cause players to rebound backwards for yards while the puck magically remains glued to their sticks. These animations don't ruin the game, but they seem out of place and tend to detract from its realism."", 'Fights are a part of hockey and are simulated in the game. I found that unless my player was seriously outmatched, I could win nearly every fight by repeatedly pressing the ""rabbit punch"" button. I have yet to see a hockey game that treats fighting in a realistic manner. That\'s why I normally play with the fighting option turned off.', 'What I appreciate most about NHL Championship 2000 is that my players can carry the puck into the offensive zone, move it around, and attempt to set up a player for a wrist shot in close to the goal or a one-timer slap shot from the blue line. The dump-and-chase tactic also works. ""Snipers"" are most effective when taking quick wrist shots in close, while power forwards will make you pay if you give them too much time to tee up for a slap shot. The game forces you to work for a good shot and gives you a feeling of accomplishment when you put the biscuit in the basket.', ""Another good feature of NHL Championship is that its puck physics are generally more realistic than those in other hockey games. The puck doesn't act like a ball bearing on ice or a Ping-Pong ball in the air as it does in NHL 2000. You can bank the puck off the boards to pass it, or clear it to center ice. Flip passes are also possible, as is dumping the puck into the offensive zone. The only puck behavior that seems out of place occurs when it flies into the air and takes forever to come down, as if filled with helium."", ""Unlike in NHL 2000, I don't feel as if the goalie and the player I'm controlling are the only players on my team playing defense. Computer-controlled players do a respectable job of forechecking, backchecking, and covering for each other. On offense, the computer sometimes makes great plays, particularly when setting up a player for a deflection. However, it also frequently tries to make too many passes and has a disturbing tendency to pass the puck back out of the offensive zone, creating an offside situation."", 'NHL 2000 and its predecessors are famous for their ""money shots"" - shot techniques that result in goals a high percentage of the time. The closest thing I found to a money shot in NHL Championship 2000 was scoring with a one-timer after winning a face-off. Realistically, this action works best when a good defense player gets the shot off quickly against a mediocre goalie. But while I scored many such goals against the computer, the computer rarely scored in this manner against me.', ""One of the problems with the EA Sports NHL games is that the interference rule is almost never enforced unless there's interference against the goalie. In NHL 98, 99, and 2000, players are routinely flattened regardless of whether they have touched the puck, which is blatant interference. Although interference is not called as often as it should be in NHL Championship 2000, illegally checking opposing players will frequently earn your player a trip to the penalty box, as it should."", 'After spending hundreds of hours playing EA Sports NHL games, getting used to the controls for NHL Championship 2000 took some time. Its system is a bit more complex, but it lets you do more. Flip passes, drop passes, dump-in shots, poke checks, shot blocks, and one-timers became second nature on my Microsoft Sidewinder gamepad. When I went back to playing NHL 2000, the controls seemed rudimentary in comparison.', 'There also are two bugs in the game worth noting. One occurs after a team pulls its goalie to gain a man advantage when a penalty is committed. After play is stopped and the power play begins, the goalie will sometimes fail to return to his position, leaving the net empty. The second occurs when the puck appears to be iced, causing the goalie to raise his arm to signal icing. But if an opposing player reaches the puck first to cancel the icing, the goalie will continue to hold his arm in the air, creating an easy scoring opportunity.', ""One basic test of a hockey game's realism is the number of shots on goal generated. While playing at the pro level and using regulation 20-minute periods, my team was able to put nearly 80 shots on goal, which would be a phenomenal number in real-life hockey. However, under similar circumstances in NHL 2000, I frequently put more than 100 shots on goal. This happens in both games for the same reasons: Passing and shooting are unrealistically accurate. Then again, most gamers would get frustrated if they missed as many passes and shots as the real-life pros do."", ""When I first started playing NHL Championship 2000, its lack of glitz and features disappointed me. But the more I played it, the more I enjoyed it. Not only was the gameplay reasonably realistic, but I also experienced amazing come-from-behind wins and heartbreaking last-second losses. However, no matter how the games turned out, I always felt as if I had won because my team played well or had lost because the opposition earned the victory. It'll be a long time before I feel like playing NHL 2000 again. -- <i>Patrick C. Miller</i> <br />--<i>Copyright 1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Players must help Tommy find his missing baby brother. Because this game is played on Nintendo\'s hand-held system, young people can interact with their favorite Rugrats characters virtually anywhere in this non-violent game that\'s suitable for kids, ages 6 to 12. (Jason R. Rich, Parents\' Choice). -- <i>From <a href=""/exec/obidos/subst/partners/marketing/parents-choice.html"">Parents\' Choice</a></i><br /><br />Did you know that you can play the Rugrats theme music with just one finger? Just tap six piano keys from left to right and back again to hear what we mean. This nugget of useless trivia isn\'t included in the press materials, but we consider it important anyway. Rugrats: The Movie is the only way you can relive the surprise holiday hit in your hands without buying a portable VCR, and to the great astonishment of many, it\'s actually pretty good. Not groundbreaking or innovative in any way, to be sure, but it does what it sets out to do well.  Don\'t go throwing away your copies of Super Mario Bros. DX or Wario Land II just yet, though - this is strictly for the kids. Grown-ups who are brave enough to admit they like watching the cartoon won\'t find a particularly challenging game here. The fact that the game only uses one button is a good indication of this. As you would expect, this game follows the basic premise of the movie - Tommy\'s newborn brother Dil has gone missing and it\'s up to the babies to find him - over a stream of side-scrolling platform levels. A special bonus for Game Boy Color players comes in the form of two overhead racing stages, where the kids drive around in the Reptar mobile collecting bonuses. They\'re a nice addition and break up the gameplay well - a shame, then, that they\'re over too quickly.  The main part of the game is made up of progressing from left to right through a number of well-detailed and extremely colorful locations, avoiding contact with pretty much anything that moves. And collecting glowing objects. Some stages require a set number of items to be pilfered, and getting them all opens up bonus levels designed solely to increase your high score. The stages are impressively large and full of hidden areas to explore, although the way the screen sometimes doesn\'t scroll until you\'re almost at the edge leads to a few needless deaths. Of course, babies aren\'t known for surviving falls from tall tables and balloons. The difficulty level is set just right - younger players can explore the levels in comfort thanks to the good collision detection and responsive controls, while those with a bit more Game Boy experience can use the generous time limits to ferret out hidden objects.  Game Boy conversions of children\'s movies usually get slammed, especially when they\'re side-scrolling platformers, but Rugrats: The Movie still has its nave charms. If you\'re a fan of the franchise then by all means, check this out.<i>--Cameron Davis</i>--<i>Copyright  1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

954,Adobe Photodeluxe 2.0,"['Adobe PhotoDeluxe 2.0 offers a fast and easy way to modify and personalize your photos. It performs a variety of tasks, including red-eye removal and shadow dropping. Smudging and cloning are popular digital tools that feature an easy-to-use interface. Import your photographs from disks, scanners, or digital cameras with seamless ease. PhotoDeluxe was designed with both the novice and professional photo editor in mind.', 'PhotoDeluxe, the consumer image editing offering from Adobe, lets you retouch, manipulate, and otherwise twist digital photos for cheap - once you understand the unusual (yet improved) interface. Keep in mind the price and the phrase ""consumer offering;"" it\'s the basis for why Adobe made PhotoDeluxe so different from other Mac applications. <P>Forget about menus, and don\'t even think about a floating tool palette. PhotoDeluxe\'s interface looks more like a Web browser or a Macromedia Director interface than a Mac app. The program takes over your screen, adding its own background and putting up a series of buttons and tabs. These are designed to walk you through specific tasks (say, making a greeting card out of a family photo), instead of letting you work in a free-form environment with a bunch of tools and a palette. Adobe spent a lot of time analyzing what consumers want from digital photos and how they go about getting it. The company adjusted PhotoDeluxe to reflect what it learned. <P>The five buttons on the left side of the screen - Get Photo, Special Effects, Cards & More, Internet, and Send - appear in the order in which you most likely will need them. First get a photo, then touch it up, make something with it, and send it (either through the Internet or to the hard drive). Once you become accustomed to working in this fashion, the interface makes a lot of sense, but it\'s a tough transition for dyed-in-the-wool Adobe Photoshop users. Then again, PhotoDeluxe does not purport to replace Photoshop. <P>PhotoDeluxe 2.0 doesn\'t tie you to choosing between guided activities and free-form work, as PhotoDeluxe 1.0 did. Instead, clicking on a button brings up some tabs that contain tools arranged in a step-by-step order, without mandating that order. The addition of the Advanced button lets you access some of the more familiar (and potent) Photoshop tools. There is some serious power here - Adobe uses lots of Photoshop code in PhotoDeluxe. <P>PhotoDeluxe 2.0\'s great new features include red-eye removal; a Clone tool (for duplicating parts of an image); editable, rotatable, and sizable text; and several photo manipulation tools. These features, especially the Clone tool addition, make PhotoDeluxe 2.0 much richer than version 1.0. Of course, some other additions, such as image management, aren\'t so great. PhotoDeluxe uses the EasyPhoto Organizer, which catalogs files in galleries. The problem is that the gallery files included with PhotoDeluxe point to images on the PhotoDeluxe CD, so unless the CD is in the drive, the sample photos and clip art are not accessible. <P>Another downside, PhotoDeluxe takes up a lot of hard disk space. A minimal install occupies more than 70MB of space, and that does not include the photo galleries included with the program. Also, it takes some time to get used to opening and saving files using galleries. <P>PhotoDeluxe is not Photoshop. Repeat this mantra if you are a Photoshop user picking up PhotoDeluxe 2.0. It will be a frustrating experience. If, however, you\'re new to digital images and simply want to play around with pictures, PhotoDeluxe will suffice, especially for the $49 price tag. - David Reynolds <P> <B>Good News:</B> Easy photo manipulation.

But the game has so many holes that it's hard to imagine any self-respecting gamer sticking with it for very long."", ""The game lets you play exhibition games, shoot around in an outdoor practice court, or take on a full season (which can run 12, 28, 56, or a full 82 games). Graphically, <i>NBA Basketball 2000</i> looks pretty good but lacks much of the polish and flash of EA's <i>NBA Live 2000</i>. Also, although many of the NBA stars in this game have been made to look like their real-world counterparts, most players on the court look plain and blocky."", 'Controlling your players is simple enough, but the artificial intelligence is so weak that you can often march a player right down the court and to the hoop without any difficulty at all. Of course, you can miss easy, open shots, while the computer routinely nails 70 to 80 percent of its jumpers, even from three-point range. The result is deceptively simple basketball action that often frustrates players with unfair game results.', 'Other weaknesses: spoken play-by-play and color commentary are usually weaknesses in sports games, but in this one these features are particularly lousy. Also, <i>NBA Basketball 2000</i> offers a paltry array of game modes and in-game features. There is no draft option, for example, and players have only four offensive plays to choose from during a game.', 'Overall, <i>NBA Basketball 2000</i> is suitable only for bargain-bin shoppers. Serious basketball fans will take no pleasure from this game. --<i>Michael E. Ryan</i>', '<b>Pros:</b>', '', ""Much like Microsoft's NBA Inside Drive 2000, Fox Sports Interactive's NBA Basketball 2000 doesn't aim to compete against EA Sports' NBA Live games on a feature-by-feature basis, which is perfectly reasonable considering how long it took EA to hone its pro-hoops sim to near-perfection. But while NBA Basketball 2000's lack of such sophisticated features as career mode, salary caps, customizable leagues, and a roster of the all-time NBA greatest players is understandable, it's difficult to understand why the game so frequently misfires on the few things it does try to simulate."", 'The first indication that things weren\'t quite right with NBA Basketball 2000 came after I\'d finished my first season game as the Charlotte Hornets, which was a decidedly unrealistic 144-128 trouncing of the Orlando Magic in which only four free throws were attempted (none by the Magic, I might add). On a whim, I decided to simulate the next game on the schedule and then resume hands-on control for the third outing, only to find that relinquishing control to the CPU can\'t be done for just one game. After choosing to let the computer statistically generate the results of my second game, I discovered I\'d forfeited control for half the season, and I found myself staring at a screen that said ""All Star Weekend"" and wondering what had just happened.', ""It's possible to avoid this hostile takeover by starting a game normally and then switching to CPU control for the remainder of the contest. But the lack of a coach-only mode means the CPU is calling all the shots, not to mention the fact that you've got to wait as the game is played out. No self-respecting sports sim released in 1999 should deny you the option to simulate the results of a single game during a season."", ""Add the season play problem to the fact that the game has a mere handful of four offensive plays, and it's easy to see that NBA Basketball 2000 is aimed at casual players looking for on-the-court thrills. But even as an action-oriented basketball game, NBA Basketball 2000 is not only disappointing, but also frustrating. Given the right video card (not a card based on any of the Voodoo chipsets), the level of detail for the players and arenas is certainly impressive - you can even see wrinkles in the players' uniforms as they head back down the court after an impressive slam dunk. And NBA Basketball 2000 developer Radical Entertainment deserves praise for accurately rendering the faces of a whole slew of NBA players, though some journeyman players don't get quite the beauty treatment of their higher-paid comrades."", ""However, NBA Basketball 2000 doesn't always look good. All the players have squared-off shoulders that make them look like animatronic mannequins in a Structure storefront, and even when the frame rate is smooth, the players move so slowly you'd think they were playing in the minor leagues. Jump-shot animations are smooth and believable (aside from the fact that the computer usually hits about three times as many jumpers as you do), but you'll see some pretty strange stuff go down once a player drives past the free-throw line on his way to the hole. Smaller players heading for a dunk often look like they've been hurled several feet toward the basket by invisible hands, and bigger players seem to defy gravity by literally hanging in the air before flicking the ball to the hoop."", ""NBA Basketball not only looks strange, but also plays poorly. The artificial intelligence routines are simply atrocious: If you're controlling the guy with the ball, you can simply advance up the court at will, pushing the defender back as if your player had a force field around him. Watch in amazement as you send your little men into the valley of the giants for dunks time and time again! Stare in awe as teammates repeatedly ignore passes and the ball flies toward the press row (hopefully knocking out Doc Rivers so you won't have to listen to his inane color commentary). Gaze in wonder as you see three or four consecutive back-court violations committed by the computer team in a single game! And then there's the way the computer team manages to snag just about every rebound on the offensive end and, nine times out of ten, turn around and convert it into two points. It's as automatic as Jordan hitting one of those soft turnaround jumpers, but not nearly as exciting."", ""What's even more frustrating is that NBA Basketball 2000 makes even the simplest tasks terribly difficult, such as tossing the ball into play after a basket and shooting free throws. The free-throw interface is a joke that makes it virtually impossible to sink a freebie even when you're controlling a guy who shoots 80-plus percent from the charity stripe. Top it off with the boring, canned commentary of Doc Rivers and Greg Papa constantly lambasting you for mistakes beyond your control, and you've got a game that's just begging you to uninstall it."", ""In the end, most NBA Basketball 2000 players will wind up dunking on the computer constantly because the game makes hitting a moderately close jump shot much harder than it should be - and yet they'll still find themselves losing because of so many mysterious turnovers and gameplay glitches. NBA Basketball 2000 might find a following among fans looking for nonstop dunks and the instant replays that invariably follow, but anyone looking for a serious hoops simulation should look elsewhere. -- <i>Stephen Poole</i> <br />--<i>Copyright 1999 GameSpot Inc.

965,Tomb Raider Gold - PC,"['Here are extra challenging levels and even an alternate ending to the instant-classic 3-D adventure game starring Lara Croft. You have heard the legends. Lara Croft bursts onto the international scene as the star of the stunning, instant classic, 3-D adventure game <i>Tomb Raider</i>. ""Unfinished Business"" provides two expert levels of Lara\'s dramatic return to Atlantis. Lara has discovered the existence of a ruined segment of the alien city, allegedly containing a hive of surviving creatures guarding an alien hatchery. In this new adventure she must destroy the aliens before they invade again.', 'Lara Croft, the protagonist in Tomb Raider, has become a sort of unwitting spokesperson for Eidos\' new computer adventure. As the cover girl for just about every hard copy gaming magazine this year, this globe-trotting, gun-happy lass had become the matron saint of a new revolution in 3D gaming before the title even hit the shelves. But does the game really live up to all the buildup? Well, seeing is believing when it comes to Tomb Raider, and playing the game with the Rendition or 3Dfx chip, which are sure to find a home soon in every serious gamer\'s computer tower (a supportive patch will be available online for these), should almost be a prerequisite. Featuring several stunningly rendered 3D worlds and many a cliff-hanging moment, Tomb Raider makes gamers pay for the whole seat, even though they only need the edge. <P> As mentioned above, in Tomb Raider you play Lara Croft, a female Doc Savage who, tired of her wealthy English upbringing, has decided that dangerous adventuring is more her cup of tea. So she abandons a life of crustless cucumber sandwiches and piano lessons, eventually meeting a wealthy tycoon who hires her to retrieve a single artifact from a ruined temple in South America. After getting the artifact, you find out that the tycoon has sicked a bunch of her henchmen on you, and that the original piece you were sent in to retrieve is one of three hidden in various unplundered tombs around the world. <P> Your adventures take place in several ""seven wonders"" scenarios, from Egyptian sphinxes, to Greek temples, to Atlantis (what game would be complete without it?), each with distinct puzzles and traps to negotiate. <P> In each level, you\'ll have to beware of the different predator animals, unidentifiable creatures, and henchmen lurking around. In many instances, you\'ll be pounced on unexpectedly by wolves, lions, gorillas, raptors, and gangling ""lava-monsters."" Lara has to execute daring rolls, jumps, and side-leaps to dodge these predators while attacking them. This is no time to join the wildlife preservation society; endangered species or not, you\'ve got to slay these pests. Sometimes, at the end of a level, you\'ll have to go up against of the ""boss"" monsters, which range from a lumbering Tyranosaur to a huge ""torso-man"" who, if he snatches you with his giant mitts, will slam you around like a rag doll. <P> So, you\'re asking, what weapons can I use on these poor crypt-dwellers who are simply trying to sustain themselves in a sealed-up tomb? With a tap of the spacebar, Lara draws out her two revolvers which automatically target any man-eating creature in the vicinity. Other more effective weapons are picked up throughout the game, including a set of magnums, a shotgun, and an Uzi. Rounds for your default weapon are unlimited, but ammo for the other weapons has to be picked up. <P> But killing is only half the fun in Tomb Raider, as Lara can perform a variety of actions to explore each eerie environment. Often you\'ll have to make Lara swim through convoluted caves to secret rooms (incidentally, this is some of the most realistic swimming movement you\'ll encounter in any game). Each level has a series of switches that you need to activate, some of which require you to heave huge blocks around and - this is probably the most fun part of the game - execute daredevil leaps to grab onto some faraway platform. <P> Tomb Raider is the exploratory game you always wished you were playing when you were trying to solve Atari Raiders of the Lost Ark.The variety of jumping and grabbing actions, the huge, sometimes vertigo-inducing worlds, and the smooth 3D graphics found in Tomb Raider are reminiscent of Mario 64, though the game\'s violent overtones and spooky ambiance definitely set it apart from the older title. On the down side though, some of Tomb Raider\'s puzzles are tedious, requiring the player to wander around a little bit too long. Graphically, it\'s a breakthrough game, but to obtain the spellbinding graphics that really make the gameplay a complete experience, you\'ll need one of the cards mentioned above. The avid 3D game enthusiast will probably shell out the extra bucks for one, especially if Quake is a resident game on her machine. <i>--Tim Soete</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

966,Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver,"[""<i>Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver</i> tells the story of Raziel, one of the undead lieutenants of the vampire lord Kain. Jealous of Raziel's newly evolved wings, Kain tears them apart and casts his former champion into the netherworld. But something--some kind of powerful entity that dwells in the netherworld--has restored Raziel to a semblance of life and has set him on a path of vengeance."", ""After this tantalizing movie introduction, you take control of Raziel in the spectral realm, where your new existence is explained to you. From there you enter the physical plane, ready to begin your quest for power and revenge. Raziel's combat moves are extremely brutal, as you'd expect from a vampire who has returned from the dead. When he finds a spear, Raziel gleefully stabs and slashes before he impales his foe, lifts it off the ground, and feasts on its soul. Doing so enhances Raziel's power, and devouring the souls of the rest of Kain's lieutenants is the only way to get the special abilities--scaling walls, phasing through gates, etc.--needed to reach Kain himself. While fun for adults, parents should take note: this game is definitely <i>not</i> suitable for kids."", ""Not everyone enjoyed Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain, a top-down action-adventure in the vein of Nintendo's classic Legend of Zelda. But many were compelled to play it through because of its remarkable story, told by its eloquent vampire protagonist. And Kain's vengeful narrative is the solitary precedent for Soul Reaver, Blood Omen's sequel, which is a 3D action game focussing on his firstborn son. As a sequel to a story, Soul Reaver expands upon Blood Omen by shifting the perspective and complicating, rather than recycling, the preexisting themes. And as a sequel to a game, Soul Reaver boldy abandons all but its most essential ties to its predecessor, even as it conspicuously resolves the original's technical problems. But while Soul Reaver starts strong, both as a testament to storytelling and technical achievement in its genre, its gameplay gradually wears thin and ultimately falls short of the game's high ambitions. <P> Kain's world of Nosgoth is teetering on the brink of destruction by the time his son Raziel rises from an ancient grave in a watery abyss. However, Nosgoth is an entirely beautiful place even in its death throes. Gentle rainfall, bleak skies, and decrepit architecture subdue what would otherwise be a majestic countryside, one so vividly realized that it often looks real. Interior architecture is similarly detailed but even more unbelievable in scope and scale. Gigantic vents and furnaces, subterrannean lakes and catacombs, and other mysterious natural, unnatural, and supernatural vistas abound and make Raziel's travels constantly impressive to behold. <P> Raziel's ability to shift from the material plane to the spectral plane at will is especially remarkable; this transition bizarrely and beautifully affects his environment, which bends and twists as its colors warp. Other special effects, including Raziel's ghostly blade from which the game takes its title, are equally stunning. However, if you can tear your eyes away from the scenery, you'll notice that some of Raziel's enemies look a little plain and that texture maps on the scenery can split at the seams from time to time. The camera angle can get confusing as well - but all these are negligible nuisances in what's an otherwise incredible-looking game. Yet in spite of its graphics, Soul Reaver's strongest technical achievement must be that the game never, ever pauses to load new scenery, a feature that will spoil you the next time you try to play just about any other action game. <P> Of course, while the scenery around Raziel will change constantly, he himself remains a constant. Fortunately, he's animated and articulated so well that you won't mind looking at his emaciated body and tattered wings as much as you might expect. Control is tight and responsive either with keyboard or game pad, and in fact, it's a real pleasure to watch Raziel lithely jump, climb, crawl, and fight - almost as much as it's a pleasure to hear him speak. Just as in Blood Omen before it, the quality of Soul Reaver's professional voice acting is matched only by the quality of its script. Characters like Raziel and Kain come alive through their speech, and Raziel's embittered conversations with his brothers make the subsequent battles feel all the more meaningful and epic. An appropriate soundtrack spurs you into action during such fights, while it inconspicuously plays in the background at all other times, though you may start to notice it becoming repetitive. <P> The soundtrack's repetition becomes evident only when the gameplay itself surrenders to routine, which happens rarely but with increasing frequency over the course of Soul Reaver. Raziel has a remarkable array of talents that should have precluded this game from ever slowing down: He can jump five times his height, he can practically fly, he has superhuman strength, he drinks souls, he shifts planes, and he's completely immortal. While these abilities come into play more often than not in Soul Reaver, at other times Raziel is reduced to such menial tasks as arranging blocks in obvious patterns to unlock doors. Some of these block puzzles are fun, while some of them are not, but there's really no question that the game has too many of them. <P> And although you wouldn't expect to lose a fight if you were immortal, Raziel's few types of foes rarely pose a threat or present any challenge. Before he acquires the Soul Reaver weapon, Raziel at least needs to think about how to dispose of his enemies using appropriate anti-vampire methods, such as throwing them in water or sunlight or burning or impaling them. But his spectral sword lets him slay his victims almost effortlessly, to the point where you'll reminisce about how you used to get by without it. <P> Fortunately or unfortunately, combat isn't frequent in Soul Reaver. More often than not you'll be working your way through the environment in search of Raziel's brothers, taking heed of your powers and weaknesses as you progress. All the while, Raziel's gifts of immortality and plane-shifting allow for unique and clever puzzles and challenges, even as they justify the elimination of frustrating save-and-reload scenarios so common in most 3D action games, in which death comes swiftly and often. Raziel gradually acquires certain powers, such as swimming and phasing through doors, but his basic skills - running and jumping - are ultimately his strongest. <P> By the end of the game you'll feel that you're relying on Raziel's peripheral abilities too often and that the action that made the first half of the game so outstanding has been almost completely replaced by badly contrived puzzles. It's practically obvious that more effort went into the first hours of Soul Reaver than the last, and it's true that the game's abrupt and entirely unsatisfying ending sequence was the consequence of a decision to cut the game short and leave room for a sequel. Apologists would argue that the game's anticlimax merely enforces your empathy for the tortured, fratricidal protagonist. But while the steady decline of the game's initially near-perfect pacing will assuredly dampen your overall experience, that doesn't change the fact that Soul Reaver is original, enjoyable, and an excellent game by any standards except its own. <i>--Greg Kasavin</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

974,Mission Impossible,"['PlayStation ~ Mission Impossible', ""The PlayStation version is a direct port of last year's N64 game with minor improvements, such as dramatic lighting effects, speech, and a quick-save feature. While these enhancements certainly make the game better than its N64 counterpart, M:I simply wasn't that great to begin with and it now feels dated in comparison to more recent spy games such as Syphon Filter, Metal Gear Solid, or even Tomorrow Never Dies. The storyline of the game loosely follows that of the original movie. A mole has infiltrated the IMF team and framed you, agent Ethan Hunt. Now you must recover the NOC list (a document that lists all the IMF operatives working undercover around the world) to lure the mole into the open so he can clear his name. To do so, you'll visit various locations that you'll recognize from the movie such as the CIA headquarters in Langley VA, where Tom Cruise hung from a rope to access the world's most secure computer. You get to do this and many other things seen in the movie, as well as embark on completely new missions. Some are fun and challenging, such as the one where you get to use a sniper rifle to take out the bad guys as they try to attack one of your team members. But levels like these are few and far between, and the majority are just plain boring.  The missions are basically broken up into two parts. One portion will have you running around the level collecting and using objects while avoiding enemy detection. The later parts are straightforward action levels where you have to do things like shoot all the bad guys you come across, jump over dangerous toxic goo, and blow up targets. For instance, on the embassy-party level, you must assume the identity of a specific guest. You have to knock him out first, but you can't just walk up and smack him or it will blow your cover. So you have to lure him away by putting nausea powder in his drink, forcing him to run to the restroom where you can knock him out unseen and then use your face maker to assume his identity. Once you've taken his appearance, making it past the guards is a breeze. There are other instances where the interaction between your character and the characters in the game is subtle but smart. For example, when you are in a place where a gun would be inappropriate, like a hospital, the characters in the hospital start screaming that you have a gun, thus causing a big stir, and security is dispatched to come and pick you up.  The visuals and camera angles in Mission Impossible are competent. All of the action is seen from a camera angle behind and above Ethan when you're in open areas. When you're in close quarters, the camera angle changes to a behind-the-back view, and if you need to see something or use the targeting crosshairs to place a careful shot, you can hit your gun button that makes Ethan transparent, letting you see through him. It's hard to miss with the Mission: Impossible theme and accompanying spy tunes, so the soundtrack is good, but the sound effects are only fair. Some sounds are quite familiar and surely have appeared in other games. The inclusion of speech in the PlayStation version of Mission Impossible is a definite plus, although more because it saves you the pain of reading lengthy text bits (as was the case in the original version) than because of its quality of acting. The accents the actors use for the Russian characters in the game are downright comical. One really helpful tool that has been added to the PlayStation version of Mission Impossible is its quick-save feature, which lets you save your progress in a level at any point without the need of a memory card. This makes the game so much easier, because you can start from where you last saved in a level so you don't have to start the whole mission over again. It trims down on a lot of frustration. Overall, Mission Impossible for the PlayStation isn't a bad game, and it's certainly better than its N64 counterpart, but compared with more recent spy games for the PlayStation, it just doesn't stand up. Even if you really enjoy the genre and have already played Syphon Filter, Metal Gear Solid, and Tomorrow Never Dies, you should still consider renting Mission Impossible before buying.<i>--Ryan Mac Donald</i>--<i>Copyright  1998 GameSpot Inc.

977,Official Formula 1 Racing - PC,"[""Eidos Interactive's first attempt at a Formula 1 game for the PC, 1997's Power F1, was an arcade-oriented affair aimed at casual racing fans who longed for the speed and thrills of the world's fastest cars without the muss and fuss of learning how these things really work. This time around, Eidos turned to French developer Lankhor in the hopes of creating something of a hybrid, one that would satisfy hard-core simmers and action hounds alike. But serving two masters well is a difficult thing to do, and as a result, Official Formula 1 Racing achieves only moderate success either as an arcade racer or as a serious simulation."", 'Official Formula 1 Racing certainly has all the requisite components for an authentic simulation. All 16 circuits, 11 teams, and 22 drivers (save Jacques Villeneuve, who\'s listed as ""Driver Williams"") from the 1998 Formula 1 World Championship season are included, with teams distributed into five categories based on their real-life performances. Despite bright, almost cartoonish scenery graphics, Lankhor\'s modeling of the circuits is extremely accurate, and the sound effects are almost uniformly superb, from the scream of the engines to the sound of air rushing by your helmet as you reach top speed on long straightaways.', ""But those achievements are offset by disappointing car graphics, especially compared with the eye-popping visuals of Ubi Soft's Formula 1 Racing Simulation. Few textures and a sparse polygon count give each a car a flat appearance - even at a resolution of 800x600, the tires are so angular they look more like nuts than wheels. And some of the animated effects you'd expect in a racing sim are either crude (the sparks that fly up from the track when you bottom out are laughable strips of orange pixels) or missing entirely (there's no smoke when slamming on brakes at high speeds, and I never saw flames or smoke coming from the engine of a disabled car)."", 'Car setup is a huge factor in the success of any Formula 1 team, but in Official Formula 1 Racing the options are few: You can adjust tire type and camber, brake ratios, wing angles, gear ratios, ride height, and the stiffness of the suspensions. This is clearly no match for the mind-boggling array of customizations available in F1 Racing Simulation and makes any of the game\'s claims to ""ultimate realism"" questionable at best. But the good news is that each adjustment does indeed have a discernible effect on performance on the track, and the small number of settings to deal with eliminates what I call ""setup anxiety"" - that disturbing feeling that there\'s some setup feature you might have forgotten that would make all the difference out on the track.', ""The inclusion of three difficulty settings is appreciated, but beginners might be dismayed to learn that these settings only affect a car's maximum speed rather than making it easier to stay competitive with the computer opponents. Expert PC drivers will probably scoff at anyone who can't keep up with these virtual versions of Hakkinen, Schumacher, Coulthard, Hill, Irvine, Herbert, and all the rest: A friend of mine grabbed the pole in three races by a staggering ten-second margin at each venue, then easily took the checkered flag in each race. But novices and intermediate players (I fall squarely in the second group) might become frustrated dealing with the highly aggressive - you might even say hostile - tactics of the computer players."", ""Sure, bump-ups and crashes are an unavoidable part of F1 racing, and in a few instances the blame for a major crash lay with my penchant for braking very hard deep into corners and turns. It also goes without saying that being aggressive is a key component of success in the world of Formula 1 Racing. But I saw these guys ram into me and one another so often that I started to wonder if Lankhor's next game would be a road-rage simulation."", ""With accidents occurring at a breakneck pace, you'd think Lankhor would have taken time to model accurately the effects of all the collisions, but that's not the case. Even what seem like minor impacts can break off a wing or snap a strut on a real-life Formula 1 car, but in this sim you often come away completely unscathed after brutal brushes against cars or walls. Out of curiosity, I decided to see what would happen if I smashed into a wall at 180mph - and after a flip into the air I found myself sitting on the grass with the car virtually undamaged as the pit crew informed me that I needed a new wing!"", ""Another area in which Lankhor should have invested a little more effort is in the user interface. The game has no mouse support, which probably sounds like a minor complaint - until you slap your steering wheel where your keyboard normally sits and find yourself reaching and fumbling around to perform even the most mundane tasks. The lack of mouse support in at least a game's setup screen indicates either incompetence or laziness - or that the game originated in France, where game developers seem to be of the opinion that pointing devices aren't in common usage among PC owners."", ""Bit if you can deal with the lack of realism and learn how to steer clear of all the wreckage, Official Formula 1 Racing does serve up some fairly exciting moments. The game does a good job of creating the sensation of extreme acceleration and incredibly high speeds, and if you can keep things together until the field thins a bit, you can expect some highly satisfying duels (unless, as noted earlier, you're simply too good for the computer opponents). Also, I was pleasantly surprised to find that Official Formula 1 Racing provided some of the smoothest Mplayer action I've had in a long, long time - and because so many Formula 1 fans live in Europe, you can usually find someone to race against almost any time of the day."", ""Official Formula 1 Racing doesn't begin to seriously challenge Ubi Soft's hold on the F1 throne, but its relaxed realism settings, healthy doses of action, good Internet performance, reasonable system requirements, and attractive price tag ($29.99 direct from Eidos) make it a decent entree for newcomers. <i>--Stephen Poole</i> <br />--<i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc.

979,High Heat Baseball 2000 - PC,"['<i>High Heat Baseball</i> provides a realistic player experience with high-resolution 3-D graphics and moves, such as running and fielding. 3DO re-creates the true look and feel of baseball. Choose from 750 MLBPA players and 38 stadiums, including four new ones. Take control of the perfect game with access to situation management and arcade action.', ""Though last year's High Heat Baseball lacked the spit-and-polish 3D graphics that most of us have come to expect from a top-level sports game, High Heat offered something that none of the other games could: realism. A game of baseball in High Heat often provided all the drama, the strategy, and the excitement of a real Major League Baseball game. This time around, with High Heat Baseball 2000, 3DO has taken a solid foundation and crafted an even better, more impressive game. At the time of this review, High Heat Baseball 2000 still had its share of problems, but it was also clearly the best action baseball game on the market."", 'Unlike last year\'s version, High Heat 2000 now has full licensing from Major League Baseball, so you no longer have to play with teams like Chicago-N and New York-A. An even more substantial change from the original release, however, is the new 3D graphics engine. Dismissed by many last year because of the 2D graphics, High Heat now sports a decent 3D engine that has enough bells and whistles to keep the game looking modern. True, the player models are still rather poor, and the batter\'s swing is still pretty weak looking, but at least the game offers a feeling of depth now. Also, High Heat is chock-full of some rather impressive player animations, such as pitchers throwing up their arms when a ball is called, teammates rushing to the aid of an injured player, and a fairly comical ""where\'s the ball?"" act when a player makes an error.', ""Gameplay is largely unchanged from last year's version. You still have the option to play in exhibition, season, home run derby, or play-off modes. A manage-only mode is available, and multiplayer support is provided for Internet, LAN, serial, and modem play (for exhibition games only). For season play, you can choose short, medium, or long seasons (16, 81, or 162 games). The home run derby is still as uninspiring (read: easy and repetitive) as last year's, but the rest of the game is as good or better than the original."", ""You can customize most facets of the game, including the designated-hitter rule, errors, wind, pitcher warm-ups, and a variable umpire setting, which is a great feature that re-creates the inconsistent strike zone we all see in the real MLB. The included player editor lets you modify every player's attributes and appearance. Also, even when you control your team in the field, you can have the computer handle batting, pitching, baserunning, throwing, fielding, and/or defensive alignment. To be honest, automatic defensive alignment is the most helpful of the bunch, since the task of constantly switching your infield depth and outfield shift can be a bit tiresome for nonmicromanagers."", 'Even more impressive this time around, High Heat now includes a minor league system and a career mode for season play, allowing you to bring along young talent to replace aging players. This is simply a tremendous feature, and though there seem to be some bugs in it (players being cut from the major league roster without your say-so, for example), it adds a wonderful dimension to the game. Of course, the minor leaguers all have made-up names (my AAA team actually had three starting pitchers named Snake), but you can change them in the player editor to reflect real-life prospects.', ""But when you get down to it, the area where High Heat shines brightest is on the virtual field. No other baseball game (with the exception of pure strategy titles like Diamond Mind) does a better job of re-creating the feel and drama of a real baseball game. Leading by five runs in the top of the ninth inning and cruising to an easy win? Think again, as the computer pounds out a few doubles back-to-back and suddenly has your bull pen scrambling to pick up the pieces. And it's not as if the game gives you the impression that it cheats to keep things close - far from it. You really get the sense that (for the most part) logical baseball decisions are being made to make the game as challenging as possible. Also, make a bad decision on a pitch or pitch location, and watch out: More often than not, a bad pitch ends up in the bleachers. Throughout it all, High Heat uses a solid statistical model that generates believable season and game stats (depending of course on your ability and the difficulty setting you choose to play)."", ""Unfortunately, the game was clearly rushed out the door, either in time for the start of baseball season (which is just pointless, really, especially when you consider the number of roster moves that occur just before the season begins) or to get out there at the same time as EA's Triple Play 2000. Whatever the reason, High Heat 2000 suffers from a number of niggling little bugs and irregularities. For starters, the game does not seem to handle days off and rest properly in the play-offs, where pitchers seem not to get the same amount of rest from day to day, causing them to make their next appearance at substantially less than 100-percent readiness. Also, the game has a nasty habit of making relievers disappear completely from your game roster after you start them warming in the pen. (Talk about a nasty surprise when you finally go to put them in the game....) Other problems include baserunning glitches that let a player return to the previous base even after passing the next one (this simply should not be allowed) and ultraconservative baserunning in general, which causes players to return to the bag before advancing even on obvious base hits. An audio problem cropped up that caused the PA announcer (a cool feature that every baseball game should have) and the play-by-play guy to call every member of my team (Cubs) Terry Adams. Finally, the game carries stats from the regular season into the play-offs.)."", ""Except for the reliever bug, all of these are minor issues. But together they smack of a hurried product. Ironically enough, 3DO had no reason to rush this product out the door. Even with its problems, it is still the best arcade baseball game on the market today. Let's hope that with the forthcoming patch High Heat Baseball 2000 can further solidify its claim to that title. <br />--<i>Michael E. Ryan</i> <br />--<i>Copyright 2000 GameSpot Inc.

984,NFL GameDay 99 - PC,"['Realistic football for your PC, with optional Internet support so you can play your friends on the Web. Lifelike detail, 3-D graphics, and authentic moves generate a true NFL experience.', 'For PC football fans, it\'s become almost a given that you can\'t have impressive on-field action and realistic league and simulation results in the same football simulation. Front Page Sports: Football Pro? Great league management, a vast array of coaching options, and solid simulation results - but anemic play on the gridiron. Madden NFL 98? Addictive gameplay and pulse-pounding drama on the field - and merely average coaching and league-play features away from it. <P> NFL GameDay 99 is no exception. If you\'re looking for a simulation that lets you use real-life lineups, create custom leagues, or launch a career that spans several seasons, you\'re out of luck here. But if you\'re in search of the most realistic - and consequently most challenging - on-field play you can find in a football simulation, GameDay 99 is at the head of the class. <P> There are lots of reasons for GameDay 99\'s success on the field, but the biggest is the artificial intelligence (AI) programming of the computer-controlled opponents. If you think you can rip off big chunks of yardage by running the same play over and over again, you\'ve got another thing coming. The defenses really do adjust to your play-calling tendencies, and gamers accustomed to steamrolling even powerhouses like San Francisco and Green Bay in other action-oriented games will be a little miffed to learn that it\'s just not gonna happen here. <P> And the AI doesn\'t slack up when a computer-controlled team gets the ball. Play against Detroit, for instance, and you might see Barry Sanders and fullback Tommy Vardell run for three nice gains in a row - but stack the line with eight men to jam up the ground game, and you\'ll probably see Herman Moore blowing by the single coverage and hauling in a TD pass. <P> Controlling the players can be a little frustrating at first, but at least it\'s because so many different actions are available. Besides the usual moves such as jumping, catching, spinning, and diving, you can also lateral the ball, make a one-handed catch, use a stiff arm (a ""swim"" move on defense), and even high step to elude a diving tackler. Actually, there are so many moves that I don\'t know of a gamepad that could accommodate them all. But there\'s still a lot you can do with an eight-button controller like a Gravis GrIP, and it\'s nice that all the special moves were included. <P> The play-by-play by Dick Enberg and color commentary by Phil Simms sound impressively accurate at first, but after a few plays you\'ll hear the same comments over and over. What\'s more, the commentary only focuses on the last play that was run: After three consecutive running plays for eight yards or more, for example, Phil Simms will make a statement like ""The offensive line isn\'t getting the job done"" if the fourth play ends with no gain. <P> Take season play, for instance. The games here aren\'t being truly simulated; instead, GameDay 99 is merely ""rolling the dice"" based on the statistical strengths of each team and using the results to generate scores and stats. Fortunately, the outcomes seem to be pretty accurate, although passing yardage seems considerably lower in GameDay 99 than in real life (around 50 yards less per side on average). <P> But that\'s about the only good news for season play. Injuries appear to be mix-and-match affairs - players can be out for two weeks with leg cramps, 13 weeks with a bruised thigh, or ten weeks with a concussion. Come on - if a guy is out ten weeks with a concussion, he\'s either retired or in a coma, and if someone had leg cramps so bad he had to miss two games, he\'d probably have to undergo an amputation. There\'s no way to generate a custom league or schedule; the single-year, six-round draft uses veterans, not rookies, and strips you of key players and forces you to draft them; and you can\'t correct errors in position for any roster other than your own (more on that later). Shorten a season game to less than 15 minutes per quarter so you can finish it more easily in one sitting, and you\'ll find that the 14 other games simulated by the computer for that week of play were 60 minutes long. <P> That last bit doesn\'t sound too crucial - just play 15-minute quarters and save the game if you have to quit before it\'s over. But in a true slap in the face to PC gamers, GameDay 99 doesn\'t feature an in-game save feature. I\'m getting sick of developers creating cross-platform titles and not bothering to include something as rudimentary as an in-game save for the PC version, especially in a football game - there\'s absolutely no justification for not being able to save whenever you like.<P> Then there are the rosters. I like to set the rosters in a football sim to match their real-life counterparts, but in GameDay 99 it\'s simply impossible. Although the README file that comes with the version 1.1 patch says the rosters were updated as of August 31, that\'s only true when you\'re playing season games: the exhibition rosters remained severely out of date. <P> But even the season rosters aren\'t kosher, because special team assignments have been completely bungled. Marquee players like Keyshawn Johnson, Chris Carter, Terrell Davis, Curtis Martin, and many other stars are assigned to kick coverage by default - and there\'s no way anyone would chance injuring a key player by having them cover kicks. Kick returners are similarly botched, with default settings that have fullbacks returning kickoffs and defensive backs bringing back punts. <P> I\'ve already mentioned that you can\'t alter any lineups other than your own, so there goes any chance of simulating a real-life matchup in GameDay 99. But at least you can easily correct player assignments for your own team, right? Once again, the answer is no. GameDay 99 doesn\'t use a real depth chart, which has assignments for kickoff returner and punt returner. The only way to change who plays on special teams before a game is to change their position on the roster. But that\'s not practical: To have the Ravens\' speedster Jermaine Lewis return punts, for example, you\'d have to make him play defensive back (he\'s a wide receiver). And to relieve Terrel Davis of kick-coverage duties permanently, you\'d have to make someone else the starting halfback. <P> GameDay 99 features the usual suite of multiplayer options - modem, serial, IPX, and TCP/IP connections are supported - and 989 Studios also hosts a matching service called 989Studios.net. To have any hope of controlling players while online, though, you\'ll need an extremely low-latency Internet connection; my guess is that 250 milliseconds would be the maximum latency for relatively smooth play. Unfortunately, the chat client lags severely whenever anything happens online, so you\'ll find it nearly impossible to type a full sentence while in the lobby without seeing extra spaces and transposed letters. <P> With NFL GameDay 99, 989 Studios managed to overcome one of the biggest obstacles facing developers of football sims: creating AI routines that not only result in computer-controlled teams playing like their real-life counterparts, but that also force the user to play in a realistic style as well. If 989 Studios can devote more attention to bringing the other areas of the game up to the level that we see on the field, the dream of a totally complete football package might finally come true. <i>--Stephen Poole</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

985,Braveheart - PC,"['<i>Braveheart</i> combines real-time strategy with global maneuvering in a sword-clashing re-creation of the battles between Scottish clansman and expansionist English aggressors. The latest 3-D engine and state-of-the-art motion-capture technology give <i>Braveheart</i> serious, make-you-cringe combat realism.', ""Braveheart is a perfect example of how an ambitious game design can end up being something of a double-edged sword. It combines strategic empire building with real-time 3D combat and takes place in late 13th-century Scotland, the same setting as the Mel Gibson movie. However, despite its intriguing premise, Braveheart's assorted play mechanics coexist about as peacefully as the Scottish clans depicted in the game."", ""Your goal is relatively simple: As the leader of one of 16 major clans, you must unite the others in order to stave off the invading English army. However, accomplishing that goal is rather difficult, even on the easiest setting. You do most of your work within the game's turn-based clan-management interface. Here you can monitor every aspect of your clan, including your territories, towns, armies, caravans, and spies. You begin the game with a single territory, a pair of armies, and a pair of leaders. From these humble beginnings, you must extend your influence through diplomacy and warfare (but mostly warfare, as you might expect from a game boasting a 3D combat engine)."", ""Leader units can not only lead an army into battle, but also take on a variety of special missions. Without a leader, armies are limited to guard duty, ambushes, patrols, or training. With a leader, an army can engage in full-fledged battles and undertake an array of diplomatic missions and covert operations, most of which can help make your campaign run a lot more smoothly. For example, you can kill an enemy leader to weaken opposing armies, or march into an enemy clan's territory and demand its unconditional surrender."", ""Missions of this sort are assigned from the turn-based interface. From here, you can also micromanage each of your towns: how much food each should produce, what type of weapons to craft, and what extra buildings and fortifications to construct. The people in your towns also have a happiness rating, which is easy to manage as long as you keep everyone fed. Trade caravans are important to your clan's economic prosperity, though controlling them tends to be a painful exercise in micromanagement. In fact, the process is so clunky, and the automatic control of caravans is so effective, that you'll wonder why manual control is even an option."", ""Micromanagement is the crux of the turn-based game. You must keep an eye on your clan's daily routine every turn. You have to continually send scouts to explore neighboring territories since you can't automate the process, and apparently know next to nothing about the surrounding lands. You have to keep sending spies to rival towns and then recall them a few days before they get captured - and then send them out again so your information remains fresh."", ""If you use the game's continuous time mode, the strategy interface updates itself in pseudo-real-time fashion. Unfortunately, this mode doesn't deactivate as described. Instead of simply hitting the continuous time key again, you have to keep clicking on a button to stop the process and regain manual control of your little empire. Since Braveheart moves along at an otherwise slow pace, continuous time mode should have been a good feature; but the awkward on/off process makes it more annoying than helpful."", ""Army management is also difficult, since your troops will grow restless and desert you after extended periods of inactivity or boring duty, such as guard detail. This is no big deal early on, but as you move further into the game and have dozens of armies and towns to manage, weeding out the discontent becomes problematic. Of course, you can simply disband your army and return all the troops to the nearby town's peasant pool. Then, you can take those peasants right back out of the pool, arm them with the same weapons, and create a new army that's pleased as punch to be on duty. The new army might not be the seasoned veterans they once were, but at least they won't desert. Of course, the other way to liven up your armies is to send them into battle. This won't always make them happy campers, but you'll at least get some use out of them while they're around. Battles occur whenever you enter an enemy town or are on a diplomatic mission and opt to attack."", 'At this point, the game halts and loads up its 3D combat engine. This usually takes about a full minute on fast machines, so you can forget about smooth transitions. Once in the 3D view, you can control your troops much like you would in Myth or any other real-time strategy game. You can control a lot of troops at once in Braveheart, as well as some pretty cool siege engines, but be warned that even on a fast system the game will slow to a crawl when the real action starts.', ""Although Braveheart lets you set your troops in various formations, most of these mean nothing in battle, since your troops won't stay in formation when they move anyway. In fact, one of the game's most disappointing aspects is the fact that battles usually end in a massive free-for-all. In most cases, he who has the most troops wins. Of course, archers help, but since you can't see the enemy until they're very close, they rarely have enough time to deal serious damage before they also begin hitting your own melee troops. There are times when a small group of veterans can hold its ground against a larger enemy force, but these are few and far between."", 'Another problem is the fact that you must typically seek out your foe, with absolutely no clue as to which direction you should travel over the rolling 3D terrain. Some might call this fog of war, but when you march into an enemy town with the express purpose of conquering it, you might at least know where that town is. In most cases, you can avoid this problem by standing still and waiting for your enemy to come find you, but this is yet another work-around that detracts from the overall experience.', ""The 3D combat sequences also suffer from poor camera controls, which are much less intuitive and far more disorienting than Myth's. At least the graphics themselves are nice; units are neatly rendered, fight valiantly, and even die dramatically. The weather effects and terrain look good as well, though the trees look terrible."", ""Braveheart's multiplayer is pretty solid, though it only supports the 3D combat portion of the game. So even though you can play the game with four players over IPX, TCP/IP, and Mplayer, you still have to deal with all the limitations and flaws of a 3D combat engine."", 'Essentially, Braveheart is a game that tried to do too many things at once. While the turn-based component is very deep, it tends to degenerate into a morass of micromanagement. And while the 3D combat sequences are interesting to look at, they run slowly and suffer from poor controls, slow loading times, bizarre hide-and-seek engagements, and an absence of real tactics. Put the two together and you have a game with lots of potential but not enough chemistry. <i>--Michael E. Ryan</i> <br />--<i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

With Army Men II, 3DO seems to have corrected a number of the original game's issues. The problem is, Army Men II fails to cash in on its solid premise and ends up feeling more like a version 1.1 release than a full-fledged sequel."", 'As the game begins, a beautifully rendered scene sets the stage for the action: Green troops stumble across a pan-dimensional teleporter that transports them to a strange world (ours). Tan troops follow them through the portal, and a firefight breaks out on a kitchen countertop far, far away. If only the game continued on like this...', 'After an all-too-brief opening mission in which you must guide your troops past roaches and electric stovetops, you all get teleported back to the world of Army Men - where you will find yourself for most of the game. Every once in a while, you\'ll get another mission back in our world, but these pop up far too infrequently. Worse yet, not a single one of the maps from the ""real world"" missions is available during multiplayer games. What 3DO was thinking here, I honestly cannot fathom.', ""Gameplay is essentially the same as in the original game. Again, you command Sarge, a hard-nosed soldier who can not only handle every weapon known to man but also drive any manner of military vehicle (including PT Boats). You view the action from a top-down perspective and guide Sarge using the keyboard and/or the mouse. The default keys take some getting used to, but you can remap them. Mouse control is sufficient most of the time, but it's not as intuitive as what you'd find in a good real-time strategy game. In case you're wondering, your troops follow your lead around the map unless you select and assign them specific orders."", 'You can also order specific units or groups of units to attack, defend, hold position, or rally around you. Additionally, you can now save your game at any point during a mission, which is nice because some of the missions have several stages. Perhaps the best new feature, however, is the addition of experience ratings for your troops. Each solider under your command gets a little more proficient with each mission he survives. In other words, it is in your best interests to keep these boys alive for as long as possible.', 'Other new things to look out for: The game now offers a few new weapons, including the super-cool magnifying glass, an M80 (woo hoo!), and an aerosol can that can be used with lighters to do lots of wonderful damage. Sarge also gets to tote around a sniper rifle, which is perhaps the best weapon in the game.', 'Army Men II seems quite a bit more forgiving than the original, with well-stepped difficulty levels that let players of any skill level move through the game. Most missions are well designed, with interesting (and often familiar) objectives and settings. There are a handful of missions that seem to have just one too many objectives - you know, the type that just never seem to end - but the rest are well thought-out and fairly challenging.', ""Of course, the horrendous pathfinding adds considerably to the challenge. Your units simply can't find their way out of a foxhole, which means that you must guide them around the maps using baby-step destination points (click a little ahead, click just a little farther ahead, and so on). This proves to be extremely aggravating, especially on missions where time is a factor. Also, the pathfinding is at its absolute worst when controlling the PT Boat. Not only can the AI not find a simple path through the water (the wide-open water, mind you) but the game keeps jerking the camera angle back to center on the boat, even when I wanted to scan around for hostiles."", 'The soundtrack deserves mention. The music is a collection of classical pieces that at times fits the situation and at others seems terribly out of place. The cutscenes, on the other hand, are fantastic and for the most part funny (especially the scene that plays when you fail a mission).', ""Multiplayer support is strong, letting up to four players compete over IPX or TCP/IP connections. Head-to-head play over serial and modem links is also supported. Army Men II provides a good skirmish mode - one in which you can actually beat the computer - and also lets you fill in empty slots in a multiplayer game with AI opponents. The setup screen for multiplayer games is slick, but the selection of maps for these games is pretty weak. Where's that cool kitchen countertop map?"", ""Overall, Army Men II is fun, but it's just not all that it could be (apologies for the weak Army joke...). Let's hope 3DO will patch the AI and the pathfinding and make some of those real-world maps available for multiplayer games. Until then, you'll probably only really like this one if you're already a big fan of the original. <i>--Michael E. Ryan</i> <br /><i>Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

While simplicity is the key to  <i>Fighting Force 2</i>, this game does lack the substance and  theatrical style that characterize <i>Syphon Filter</i> and other  offerings. <i>--Robb Guido</i>"", '<b>Pros: </b>', '', ""If you're lucky, you don't remember the original Fighting Force. The game tried to resurrect the Final Fight-style game by providing scads of bad guys you could beat by simply pounding on the punch button until everyone was dead. To put it bluntly, the first Fighting Force was not a good game. Fighting Force 2 takes the same basic beat-'em-up ethic and melds it with a pinch of Lara Croftian camera work and a smidgen of Metal Gear-esque espionage. The resulting game is better than the original, but it still comes off as an incredibly dull piece of software. The game sends you on several different missions, but your objective never really matters. You just plod through level after level, beating up anyone in your path and breaking all sorts of enemy equipment along the way. Just about anything you see can be destroyed if you hit it enough times. That's right, your character has the ability to make soda machines explode using only his bare fists. Heck, even an office chair will explode if you kick it hard enough. This is incredibly silly, especially when guns and health pickups start flying out of the copy machine you just stabbed with your knife. This is also just about the only cool element in the entire game. The enemies are painfully easy to defeat, especially given the copious amount of weapons you'll find along the way. Anything you can make explode could potentially contain another weapon for your inventory. Weapons include pistols (which our hero holds sideways like the true gangsta he is), a shotgun, knives, grenades, sledgehammers, pipes, and axes. The inventory is controlled by holding down a button and scrolling through your items until you find one you like - it's not a perfect scheme, but it works well enough. OK, the gameplay is weak and generic. The sound is occasionally sketchy. The controls are a little too touchy. But at least the game is fairly pleasing to the eye. Though there are occasionally some clipping problems and some bad seams here and there, the game generally looks pretty good. The textures are nice and crisp, and the animation is fluid. The behind-the-back camera works well, though it has lots of problems in small rooms. There's really nothing exciting about Fighting Force 2. The ease of gameplay makes it feel less like a game and more like an exercise. So you'll just wander around kicking everything in sight until sheer boredom forces you to turn the game off - which, depending on your tolerance level, will be anywhere from ten minutes to three hours. Yes, this game is better than the original Fighting Force - but that's really not saying much. Fighting Force 2 would make a decent rental, if only to laugh at the exploding office chairs, but not much else.<i>--Jeff Gerstmann</i>--<i>Copyright  1998 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

990,Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation,"['Lara Croft returns once again in the fourth installment of the popular <i>Tomb Raider</i> series. The newest effort brings Internet pinup Lara back to the Egyptian tombs that she roamed in the series opener (the now classic <i>Tomb Raider</i>). Our heroine must seek out Horus, an Egyptian god that has the ability to capture the evil soul Set. With a combination of puzzle solving and sharp gaming skills, Lara will navigate through numerous Egyptian locations, including Cairo, Karnak, Giza, Valley of the Kings, and Alexandria.', ""This game promises to unveil vital background information on Lara Croft, who has emerged as an Internet cult icon since the release of the original <i>Tomb Raider</i> in the mid-'90s. At one point in the game, you will flash back to Lara at age 16 to see the origin of her adventurous spirit that precedes her full-fledged career as a tomb raider."", 'While gameplay remains faithful to the preceding titles in the series, there are also several new gameplay elements to explore, including a new inventory system, new weapons, and new moves.', 'The ubiquitous Lara Croft is back. After multiple appearances on  the  PlayStation, the aging icon is back to face her ""last revelation"" before  moving  on to the PlayStation2.

991,Gulf War: Operation Desert Hammer,"['If you can get past Gulf War\'s rather paranoid premise, you\'ll find an arcade-style tank shooter that handles decently enough at first but winds up tripping over its treads after a while. You\'ve been chosen from the ranks of the UN peacekeepers to pilot the powerful and agile M12 Hammer tank. Your mission is to forge a path through Iraq all the way to Baghdad to allow your cohorts to, as the publisher puts it, ""go back and finish what we started with Desert Storm."" If you succeed, you and your fellow freedom fighters will finally be able to put an end to the SCUD missile-hoarding, clandestine chemical warfare-researching menace of the Middle East. <P> If the story sounds a bit jingoistic, it is. The game begins with stock footage clips of tanks, fighter jets, and innocent Iraqi men, women, and children in the throes of terrible suffering, while a faux Walter Kronkite narrator decries the evil of the Iraqi dictatorship (or ""the Beast,"" as your mission briefings refer to him/it). Presumably, the concept was chosen in light of the UN weapon-inspection debacle that took place earlier this year, though the emphasis on the political and moral evil of the regime seems a bit out of place in an arcade-style shooter. Upon completion of each mission, you\'ll be treated to a similar cutscene, but fortunately you can skip them with the touch of a button. <P> Once the cutscenes are done and the game begins, you\'ll find that the Hammer is equipped with an infinite-ammo chain gun and a limited cache of different types of missiles. It travels at a surprisingly brisk pace, and since aiming is performed entirely by a sensitive free-roaming mouselook, its turrets can rotate 180 degrees or more in the blink of an eye. The default control configuration uses mouselook both to aim and steer; simply point your turret in the direction you want to move and press the up or down arrow key to move forward or in reverse. Pressing the delete key unlocks your turret from steering and lets you turn using the arrow keys and aim with the mouse, a control setup that proves to be more practical since it allows you to circle-strafe your target. <P> Toss in some great graphics, interesting enemies, a killer soundtrack, and great level designs, and you\'d have a winner. Unfortunately, Gulf War doesn\'t quite go that far. No doubt in the interest of wider accessibility, Gulf War\'s system requirements are nice and low, which means high-end users won\'t have much to look at. All tanks in the game (including your own) look decent enough but aren\'t very detailed, while buildings, radar towers, and oil rigs look similarly distinctive but comparably plain. Shooting up enemy tanks and structures will occasionally reward you with a nice-looking explosion of orange haze transitioning to smoke, but in most cases you\'ll only get a small and uninspired burst of flame. Since blasting an enemy usually doesn\'t obliterate it - a defeated enemy will usually collapse into a clump of gray polygons (which clutter up the landscape if not cleared away with more shots) - shooting up the bad guys is decidedly unsatisfying. And with the exception of a handful of dark-gray military buildings (which exist only for you to destroy them), the Iraqi theater of war is one big, monotonous yellow desert, with an occasional oasis that looks like nothing more than a patch of blue desert. <P> It makes matters worse that the in-mission music is similarly low-key, presumably so that you can focus on the action. At least the voice-over in the mission briefings serves its purpose well, though the in-mission effects are weak. Explosions are subdued and slightly muffled and your thoroughly unimpressive chain gun sounds like nothing more than drumming your fingers against sheet metal. <P> But Gulf War isn\'t about graphics and sound. It\'s about shooting up the bad guys. Unfortunately, there are only a handful of enemy tanks, an enemy chopper, and a manned bunker, and essentially all they do is fire continuously at you when you\'re in range. You can park right in front of an enemy tank, exchanging gunfire until it explodes (you\'re more heavily armored than most enemies, so you\'ll invariably win the encounter), and it won\'t make any sort of effort to evade or even move the entire time. Once you\'re done destroying all the enemies that can actually shoot back, all that\'s left are a bunch of immobile enemy structures and helpless targets like convoy trucks and grounded jets. Unless one of these is flagged as being a crucial target for your mission, you can choose to attack it or leave it; Gulf War\'s completely linear mission structure has no scoring system whatever, so it doesn\'t matter if you destroy it or not. Many of your missions will therefore be marked by an almost Twilight Zone-esque contrast; one second, you\'ll be in the middle of a firefight, and the next, you\'re all alone, futilely shooting at silent, defenseless buildings and vehicles that fold like cardboard. <P> Gulf War\'s 18 linear levels are as monotonous as the desert in which they take place. With one exception, in which you must defend a civilian news truck, every single mission requires you to drive around and blow stuff up, and that\'s basically it. Aside from whatever damage you\'ll suffer along the way from your lackluster opposition, the only thing that will keep you from heading directly to your mission objective are impassable landmarks, like tall mountains and less-tall hills, which your Hammer tank may or may not be able to traverse. However, attempting to cut across hills isn\'t strategically favorable, as the game\'s fixed, third-person chase view obscures the area directly in front of your tank when you\'re climbing an elevated surface, creating a blind spot behind your tank in which you can\'t see let alone aim. <P> Even so, Gulf War accomplishes its goal of offering simple, decent-looking arcade action with modest system requirements. Unfortunately, its linear missions make it a forgettable single-player experience, and its mediocre graphics and simplistic gameplay don\'t do much for it otherwise. <i>--Andrew Seyoon Park</I> <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

995,Cutthroats: Terror on the High Seas - PC,"['Sealed CD plus printed manual packaged in zip-lock bag. No box. Fast professional shipping.', 'Veteran gamers with fond memories of Sid Meier\'s Pirates! probably feel inclined to jump at every chance to lead a band of pirates on a ruthless quest for wealth and glory. But their high hopes will probably be dashed when they get their hands on this latest strategy game from the developers of Gangsters. While Cutthroats covers all the bases when it comes to the world of 17th-century piracy, in the end it feels more like an accounting class than a life of swashbuckling and freebooting. <P> You play as a pirate captain, starting with a single ship in the Caribbean between 1635 and 1700; the date you select determines how difficult the game will be. You get to read about the current events involving all the major seagoing powers of the time, but unfortunately this information is presented in the tiniest of print - a characteristic carried over from the manual, which is a Reader\'s Digest-sized book with a minuscule typeface. Straining to read the light-black type on a gray background is painful, and it takes over 150 pages (excluding history, designer notes, and glossary) to explain what\'s involved in being a successful pirate. Why all the wordage? Because Cutthroats\' interface - a mind-boggling array of icons on nearly every screen - isn\'t the least bit intuitive. <P> Before heading out on your first voyage, it\'s a good idea to head into town and recruit a few more crewmen, pick up a couple of extra cannons, and perhaps pay a visit to the governor to try to get on a good footing with him. Once that\'s done, it\'s time to set sail, but unfortunately what should be the most exciting part of any pirate game - attacking ships and pillaging towns - is where Cutthroats is least satisfying. <P> You can order the crewmen in the crow\'s nest to notify you when enemy ships approach, and when that happens, you can switch to an overhead view looking directly down on your ship. Once there, you\'ll eventually learn how many ships you\'ve encountered and, if you get close enough, what flags the ships are flying and what types of vessels they are. The problem is that there\'s no way to jump back to the strategic map immediately after you determine you don\'t want an encounter - only when the sighted ships get far enough away does that option become available. <P> The graphics for both sea- and land-based combat are laughably bad, like what you might expect from a Sega Genesis game from six years ago. What\'s more disappointing is the combat interface and ship behavior. You should be able to outrun and outmaneuver a ""battleship"" (a term that wasn\'t even used in the 17th century) with your sloop. But should an unfriendly ""battleship"" spot you, you can pretty much count on being hunted down - even if it takes 10 or 15 minutes of real time for the enemy to finally close and engage (why isn\'t there an ""accelerate time"" feature?). There\'s also no display of wind direction in the battle view, so the only way to determine wind direction is by steering until you find which way you\'re going the fastest. <P> Battles are drab and boring, but at least you\'ve got a nice variety of options: You can choose the type of shot (round, chain, grapeshot) or whether you want to fire muskets only, to grapple and board, or even ram your opponent. But these again are all represented with tiny icons called up by right mouse-clicks, and in the heat of battle you can easily get confused as you try to navigate and issue battle commands. At other times you\'ll see some truly strange happenings: Your ships might run aground and sink for no apparent reason, and hostile ships will get locked going round and round in circles. <P> Boarding enemy vessels ought to be a bloody affair, but in Cutthroats all you get for excitement is another miniature display of two guys about eight pixels tall fighting with swords, with numbers on the left and right showing how many men each side has left. Watching these events unfold is thoroughly boring, and the constant chatter of your commanders (""We\'ll send \'em to Davy Jones\' locker!"") doesn\'t help things one bit. There\'s no real reason to expect a complicated land-combat component when you\'ve got so few men to deal with, but there\'s also no excuse for the pathetic character graphics. <P> Cutthroats\' most interesting aspect is its economic model. After successful raids, you can head to friendly ports and exchange your booty for cash, then use your earnings to buy stuff for your crew (rum and food are high priorities), buy more ammunition, recruit new commanders and crewmen, bribe officials, and generally work the market. By exchanging information with ships you meet, you can find places where your cargo is in demand and make even more money. The interface for all this is on the complicated side, but once you get into it, it\'s actually pretty engrossing, and at least the graphics here are utilitarian if not actually impressive. <P> If you\'re into micromanagement and can stand simplified combat and poor graphics, Cutthroats should provide you with enough to keep you happy for a while. But if you\'re looking for a game that re-creates the drama and violence of 17th-century pirating, you won\'t find it here.<I>--Stephen Poole</I> <P> --<i>Copyright &copy;1998 GameSpot Inc.

But while the game worked very well on the PC - a platform devoid of all things punching and kicking - whoever was in charge of the PlayStation version forgot to port the fun over to the Sony console. Urban Chaos takes place in Union City. You, as D\'arci Stern, rookie cop, must first work through a few training missions, which detail things like how to fight and how to control a vehicle. Then it\'s off to the city streets. In each level, you\'re given a few main objectives to accomplish. In one, you must arrest at least one mugger and return an abandoned vehicle to the station. In another, you have to find a way to get a suicidal man down from a building (and no, pushing him off isn\'t a valid way). Secondary, optional objectives will occasionally pop up as well, asking you to find a stolen police car or find a murderer. From a premise and design standpoint, Urban Chaos sounds like a winner. But there are many, many factors working against the game. For starters, the graphics are horrible. The character models are incredibly blocky, almost every texture in the game is ugly and warped, and the draw-in distance is about 25 feet in front of you, ensuring that you\'ll never be able to get a clear view of any action until you\'re right on top of it. The sound is decent. The game features lots of speech that typically works well. The control is decent, though it may be a bit too loose for some players to get a handle on, and the fighting could have been handled much better. Also, the game tries to use action-specific music. Normally, the game is silent, except for the sounds of the streets. But when you start running, a little loop starts playing. It\'s a nice concept - too bad the loop is almost too short to count as actual music and gets annoying after only a few seconds. The PC version of Urban Chaos really had a lot going for it, and at its core, it was already a very console-style game. However, Eidos simply chose the wrong console, as the PlayStation version of Urban Chaos is ugly and almost completely unplayable. If you\'ve got a PC capable of playing the original version, check it out, and try to forget that the PlayStation version even exists.<i>--Jeff Gerstmann</i>--<i>Copyright  1998 GameSpot Inc.

999,Tail Concerto: Playstation 1,"['Tail Concerto is an action-adventure platforming game featuring three-dimensional characters and environments. Players control the character Waffle, who pilots a semi-humanoid mecha called the ""Police Robo"" with the ability to run, jump, climb on ledges, and hover in mid-air for brief periods.', 'After bouncing between Activision and a few other US publishers, Tail Concerto has finally been released in the US. Originally developed by toy mega-marketer Bandai, Tail Concerto represents a shockingly uncharacteristic attention to originality and production value. A delightful, light 3D platformer perfect for gamers of all ages, Tail Concerto doesn\'t quite live up to its potential, but it is enjoyable all the same. <P>Tail Concerto takes place in the fantasy world of Prairie, a floating archipelago inhabited by bipedal, anthropomorphized dogs and cats. Racial strife is rampant - the cats of the world, lacking government representation, feel oppressed by the dogs who rule over Prairie. Three feline sisters, Alicia, Flare, and Stare recruit a small army of adorable kittens and form the Black Cats Gang, a radical military organization designed to help the cats split away and form their own nation. Influenced by the nefarious Fool, they seek five legendary crystals, which they believe can create a nation for them. Unbeknownst to the three sisters, the crystals are actually the key to resurrecting the Iron Giant, an apocalyptic robot whose enormous pieces are embedded throughout Prairie\'s islands. Enter Waffle, a work-a-day cop with a floppy-armed robotic suit. Having foiled the Black Cat Gang\'s first attacks, Waffle gets the unfortunate assignment of locking up the three sisters, as well as apprehending any minions encountered along the way. <P>As cliche as much of Tail Concerto\'s story is, its gameplay is surprisingly fresh for a 3D platformer. Waffle\'s suit is equipped with a bubble gun, a teleport device, and the aforementioned floppy arms. The bubble gun will can damage any enemy vehicles, as well as temporarily immobilize any fleeing kittens. After grabbing the cats, Waffle tosses them into the teleporter on his back, instantaneously whisking them away to prison. On a more sadistic note, Waffle can also pick up pieces of furniture in people\'s houses and smash them against walls, serving no real purpose in the game. More useful, especially on the bosses, is the ability to pick up and lob back the bombs that the enemies generally attack with. Waffle\'s suit can also perform a majority of the other 3D platformer basics, such as climb and move hand-over-hand while hanging. In one stage, Waffle can equip his suit with a jetpack, fly about a huge debris field, and hop from island to island, occasionally pausing to let his jets cool. Even though Tail Concerto is primarily an action game, a number of little quests, spoken dialogue, and anime cutscenes are liberally scattered throughout the game to move the story forward and keep the game from becoming mindless. <P>Prairie is a beautifully envisioned 3D world, complete with forests, floating reefs of island debris, and huge mechanical fortresses. Virtually every surface is textured, and each environment is alive with animation and detail. Tail Concerto\'s 3D engine is speedy enough, but it has a high rate of polygon dropout and sorting errors. The game\'s camera intelligently pans most of the time, but it has trouble in some tight places. During action scenes, you can adjust the camera\'s position relative to Waffle, allowing for some minor control. Limited as it may be, the standard viewpoint is sufficient almost all the time, with the extra camera angles just helping out in a few situations. The game\'s excellent anime sequences, fluidly animated and lushly colored, also show an impressive level of effort. Tail Concerto\'s music is not as grand as the game\'s title might imply, however. The peaceful and subdued score is fairly hummable, but it does not stand out enough to warrant any special mention. On an unfortunate note, Bandai of Japan deemed the beautiful J-Pop intro song of the Japanese version to be ""for Japan only,"" and replaced it in the US version with a rather weak orchestral piece. The game\'s sound effects are clear and effective, using voice often to tell the game\'s story and add personality to the boss encounters. Atlus\' text and voice adaptation is very well done overall, truly giving the player the feeling of an interactive cartoon. <P>Tail Concerto\'s only real flaw is its length. Experienced players will breeze through the game in less than five hours, almost never having to push the limits of their gaming prowess. The game feels as though it could\'ve been a lot more. For example, the jetpack stage is practically only a bonus stage, but it could\'ve been used as a training session for a real jetpack action scene. Instead, the jetpack is nothing more than a gimmick for one minor quest. With gaping holes of opportunity like that, some players are bound to feel a tinge of dissatisfaction after completing the game. <P>Bandai has an excellent starting point for a series on its hands. Tail Concerto\'s furry world and gameplay basics could create an exceptional game when fleshed out beyond their current state. Even in its current state, however, Tail Concerto is definitely worth a look - games this pleasant and light don\'t come along that often, and they are a welcome change from the norm. --Peter Bartholow <BR>--<i>Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc.
